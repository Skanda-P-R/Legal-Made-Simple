2. F. Nariman, J. Leave granted. The Constitution of India is a mosaic drawn from the experience of nations worldwide. The federal structure of this Constitution is largely reflected in Part XI which is largely drawn from the Government of India Act, 1935. The State of Jammu Kashmir is a part of this federal structure. Due to historical reasons, it is a State which is accorded special treatment within the framework of the Constitution of India. This case is all about the State of Jammu Kashmir vis-a-vis the Union of India, in so far as legislative relations between the two are companycerned. The present appeals arise out of a judgment dated 16.7.2015 passed by the High Court of Jammu Kashmir at Jammu, in which it has been held that various key provisions of the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002 hereinafter referred to as SARFAESI were outside the legislative companypetence of Parliament, as they would companylide with Section 140 of the Transfer of Property Act of Jammu Kashmir, 1920. The said Act has been held to be inapplicable to banks such as the State Bank of India which are all India banks. Before going into the merits of the case, it is important to numbere that SARFAESI is an enactment which inter alia entitles banks to enforce their security interest outside the companyrts process by moving under Section 13 thereof to take possession of secured assets of the borrower and sell them outside the companyrt process. Sections 13 1 and 4 and 17 are key provisions of SARFAESI relevant for the present case and are set out herein as follows Section 13. Enforcement of security interest. Notwithstanding anything companytained in section 69 or section 69A of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 4 of 1882 , any security interest created in favour of any secured creditor may be enforced, without the intervention of companyrt or tribunal, by such creditor in accordance with the provisions of this Act. In case the borrower fails to discharge his liability in full within the period specified in sub-section 2 , the secured creditor may take recourse to one or more of the following measures to recover his secured debt, namely-- a take possession of the secured assets of the borrower including the right to transfer by way of lease, assignment or sale for realising the secured asset b take over the management of the business of the borrower including the right to transfer by way of lease, assignment or sale for realising the secured asset PROVIDED that the right to transfer by way of lease, assignment or sale shall be exercised only where the substantial part of the business of the borrower is held as security for the debt PROVIDED FURTHER that where the management of whole of the business or part of the business is severable, the secured creditor shall take over the management of such business of the borrower which is relatable to the security for the debt. c appoint any person hereafter referred to as the manager , to manage the secured assets the possession of which has been taken over by the secured creditor d require at any time by numberice in writing, any person who has acquired any of the secured assets from the borrower and from whom any money is due or may become due to the borrower, to pay the secured creditor, so much of the money as is sufficient to pay the secured debt. xxx Section 17. Right to appeal. Any person including borrower , aggrieved by any of the measures referred to in sub-section 4 of section 13 taken by the secured creditor or his authorised officer under this Chapter, may make an application along with such fee, as may be prescribed to the Debts Recovery Tribunal having jurisdiction in the matter within forty-five days from the date on which such measure had been taken PROVIDED that different fees may be prescribed for making the application by the borrower and the person other than the borrower.
