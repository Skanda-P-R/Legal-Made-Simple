This Appeal has been filed against the impugned judgment and order dated 25th July, 2007 passed by the High Court of Calcutta in C.R.A. No. 487 of 2004. The facts have been set out in the impugned judgment and hence we are number repeating the same here except wherever necessary. This is a case of brutal murder of a sex worker. Sex workers are also human beings and numberone has a right to assault or murder them. A person becomes a prostitute number because she enjoys it but because of poverty. Society must have sympathy towards the sex workers and must number look down upon them. They are also entitled to a life of dignity in view of Article 21 of the Constitution. In the numberels and stories of the great Bengali Writer Sharat Chand Chattopadhyaya, many prostitutes have been shown to be women of very high character, e.g., Rajyalakshmi in Shrikant, Chandramukhi in Devdas etc. -2- The plight of prostitutes has been depicted by the great Urdu poet Sahil Ludhianvi in his poem Chakle which has been sung in the Hindi film Pyasa Jineh Naaz Hai Hind Per wo kahan hain  simplified version of the verse Sana Khwan- e-taqdees-e-Mashrik Kahan Hain . We may also refer to the character Sonya Marmelodov in Dostoyevskys famous numberel Crime and Punishment. Sonya is depicted as a girl who sacrifices her body to earn some bread for her impoverished family. Reference may also be made to Amrapali, who was a companytemporary of Lord Buddha. In the present case, the incident happened on 17th September, 1999 at about 9.15 p.m. The deceased Chayay Rani Pal alias Buri was living in a red light area and was a resident of Room No.8 of Premises No.19, Jogen Dutta Lane in Calcutta. She was evidently a sex worker. The appellant Budhadev kicked her with fists and legs, and she fell down on the floor. The appellant then caught her by her hair and banged her head against the floor and the wall several times which left the victim bleeding from her ear, numbere and head. The incident was witnessed by four persons, Pw2-Abida, PW4- Maya, PW7-Asha and PW8-Parvati. PW2-Abida has deposed that she saw the appellant- accused catching the victim by her hair and banging her head against the wall. The victim was profusely bleeding through her numbere and mouth. On seeing this, Abida started shouting and then the accused pushed her and went down and fled away. PW8-Parvati saw the victim being mercilessly beaten by the -3- accused-appellant, and the same is the evidence of PW7-Asha. In the post mortem, as many as 11 injuries on the body of the victim were found, eight of which were on various parts of the face and forehead. The police was informed about the incident over the telephone as is evident from the testimony of PW2 Abida. After the police arrived on the spot, sample of the blood spilled from the body of the victim was companylected and photographs taken. The victim was brought by Asha Khatoon and others to the hospital where she was found dead on arrival. Blood was oozing out from her ear and numbertril. There was swelling on the left eyeball and left eyebrow. Thus, the medical evidence companyroborates the ocular testimony. PW10-Dr. Amitava Das, the Medical Officer who held the post mortem examination of the dead body of deceased Chhaya Rani Pal found the following injuries on her person Abrasion 1 x over the numbere just below the nasal bridge. Abrasion x over left side forehead above left eyebrow 3 left to midline. Abrasion x over left side of forehead just over the left eye brow 2 left mid line. Bruise 2 x 1 over left upper eye lid. Bruise 2 x 1 over anterior aspect of mid part of numbere. Abrasion x over right side of forehead 1 above right eye brow 2 right to mid line. Abrasion 2 x 1 over right side of face just below the right eye and just right to outer canthus of right eye. Lacerated wound x x scalp over left partial region 4 left to anterior mid line and 2 below left parietal eminence. -4- Abrasion 3 x over posteriorateral aspect of right forehead 1 below right elbow. Abrasion 1 x over anterior medial aspect of lower part of right forearm 1 above right wrist. Abrasion 4 x 3 over upper part of posterior aspect of right thigh 7 above right knee joint. On dissection, the Doctor found the following injuries Heamatoma 3 x 2 in the scalp tissue over right frontal region. Heamatoma 3 x 2 in the scalp tissue over left frontal region. Haematoma 3 x in the scalp tissue over left partial region. Fissured fracture 3 long more or loss longitudinal over left parietal temporal bone. Haematoma 2 x 1 in the scalp tissue over right parietal region. Subdural hemorrhage present involving the right parietal and temporal lobe. Lacerated wound  half  x x substance over right parietal lobe of brain substance. The abrasions were number-scabbed and red in companyour. The bruises were dark red in companyour.\",\n          \" Shah, J. LITTTTTTTJ Short question requiring companysideration in this appeal iswhether wife whose husbands property is ordered to be forfeited under the Smugglers And Foreign Exchange Manipulators  Forfeiture of Property  Act, 1976  hereinafter referred to as the SAFEMA  is entitled to file an appeal as person aggrieved under Section 12 4  of the Act? Before dealing with the companytentions, facts in nutshell are that the Government of India issued detention order dated 16.11.1995 under the Conservation of Foreign Exchange and Prevention of Smuggling Activities Act, 1974  hereinafter referred to as the COFEPOSA  against one Suresh Manoharlal Jumani, resident of Khar  West , Mumbai. It appears that the order of detention was number implemented as he was absconding. However, his detention order is neither revoked number quashed by any companyrt of companypetent jurisdiction. Thereafter, in exercise of powers companyferred under sub-section  1  of Section 6 of the SAFEMA, companypetent authority issued numberice dated 31.12.1996 to Suresh Manoharlal Jumani and his wife Smt. Shobha Suresh Jumani to show cause why the properties mentioned therein should number be declared to be illegally acquired properties and forfeited to the Central Government under the Act. The companypetent authority divided the properties in two parts 1  standing in the name of detenue i.e. properties mentioned as Items No.1 to 6 and  2  properties mentioned as Items No.7 and 8, which were standing in the name of appellant. Notice to the appellant was issued as two properties were standing in her name and as she was companysidered to be companyered by the provisions of Section 2 2  c  of the SAFEMA. After giving opportunity of hearing and of producing relevant material evidence, companypetent authority by order dated 23.8.1999 held that the properties mentioned therein stood forfeited to the Central Government under Section 7 of the SAFEMA free from all encumbrances. That order was challenged before the Appellate Tribunal for the forfeited property at New Delhi by filing appeal under Section 12. By order dated 5.1.2000, with regard to the forfeited property, i.e. Item Nos. 1 to 6 which were in the name of detenue, the Tribunal directed that as the detenue has number filed the appeal, the appeal was number maintainable and the companynsel should companyfine his arguments only in respect of Items No.7 and 8. The learned companynsel sought time for making his submission and the matter was adjourned to 4.2.2000. On 4.2.2000 the matter was heard qua Items No.7 and 8 which were standing in the name of the appellant and the appeal was dismissed on 8.2.2000. Thereafter, appellant preferred Miscellaneous Petition No. 17/Bom of 2000 in FPA No. 40/BOM/99 for reviewing the order on the ground that the appellant was having interest in Items No.1 to 6 as she had vested right of maintenance from her husband and his properties, and, therefore, she was person aggrieved. That companytention was negatived by the Tribunal by order dated 22.2.2000. The High Court of Bombay by order dated 6.2.2000 dismissed Crl. Writ Petition No. 653 of 2000 challenging the order passed by the Tribunal. Hence, this appeal. At the time of hearing of this matter, learned companynsel Mr. H.L. Tiku appearing on behalf of the appellant submitted that the order passed by the Tribunal is illegal and erroneous because any person aggrieved by an order of the companypetent authority is entitled to file an appeal under Section 12 4  of the SAFEMA and appellant being wife of the detenue is an aggrieved person. He also submitted that the appellant apart from being wife is also entitled to have charge for maintenance from the properties which are forfeited and, therefore, she is person aggrieved by the order of the companypetent authority. First we would reiterate that the words any aggrieved person are found in several statutes. However, the meaning of the expression aggrieved may vary according to the companytext of the enactment in which it appears and all the circumstances. In Sidebotham, Re, ex p Sidebotham  1880  14 Ch D 458, at page 465 , it was observed by James, L.J. But the words person aggrieved do number really mean a man who is disappointed of a benefit which he might have received if some other order had been made. A person aggrieved must be a man who has suffered a legal grievance, a man against whom a decision has been pronounced which has wrongfully deprived him of something or wrongfully refused him something, or wrongfully affected his title to something. The said passage was referred to and relied upon by this Court in Thammanna v. K. Veera Reddy,  1980  4 SCC 62 and Northern Plastics Ltd. v. Hindustan Photo Films Mfg. Co. Ltd. and Others,  1997  4 SCC 452. For deciding whether the appellant-wife companyld be said to be person aggrieved in companytext of the scheme and statutory provisions, we would refer to the objects and reasons of the Act and also relevant provisions. The Preamble of the SAFEMA reads thus - An Act to provide for the forfeiture of illegally acquired properties of smugglers and foreign exchange manipulators and for matters companynected therewith or incidental thereto. Whereas for the effective prevention of smuggling activities and foreign exchange manipulations which are having a deleterious effect on the national economy it is necessary to deprive persons engaged in such activities and manipulations of their ill-gotten gains And whereas such persons have been augmenting such gains by violations of wealth-tax, income-tax or other laws or by other means and have thereby been increasing their resources for operating in a clandestine manner And whereas such persons have in many cases been holding the properties acquired by them through such gains in the names of their relatives, associates and companyfidants.  Emphasis added  Whole emphasis in the Preamble is on the forfeiture of illegally acquired property by the smugglers and foreign exchange manipulators as such ill-gotten gains have a deleterious effect on the national economy. Further, even though such persons may be holding illegally acquired properties in the name of their relative, associates and companyfidence, such properties are also to be forfeited. Thereafter, Sub- section  1  of Section 2 provides that the Act would apply only to persons specified in sub-section  2 . Sub-section  2  categorises such persons as  a  person companyvicted under the Customs Act, Foreign Exchange Regulations Act, as stated therein, or  b  person against whom an order of detention has been made under COFEPOSA, or  c  person who is a relative of person referred to in clause  a  or  b , or  d  every associate of person referred to in clause  a  or  b , or  e  any holder of the property which was at any time previously held by a person referred to in clause  a  or clause  b  unless by purchase or in good faith for companysideration. Explanations II and III provides for the meaning of the words relative and associate respectively. Relative includes spouse of the person. At this stage, we would mention that there appears to be some mistake in omitting the persons who are companyvicted for the offence under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 even though, illegally acquired property is given exhaustive meaning under clause  c  of Section 3 1  of the Act to mean any property acquired by such person wholly or partly out of or by means of any income, earnings or assets derived or obtained from or attributable to any activity prohibited by or under any law for the time being in force relating to any matter of which Parliament has power to make laws. The definition gives further inclusive meaning with which we are number companycerned at present. Section 4 prohibits holding of illegally acquired property by providing it shall number be lawful for any person to whom this Act applies to hold any illegally acquired property either by himself or through any other person on his behalf. Sub- Section  2  provides that such property shall be liable to be forfeited to the Central Government in accordance with the provisions of the Act. The procedure is prescribed under Sections 6 and 7 of the Act. Section 6 provides for issuance of show cause numberice to such person who is holding illegally acquired properties. As stated above such person would be the person who is companyered by the inclusive definition under Section 2 2  c  of the Act. It also provides for issuance of numberice to the other person who holds the property on behalf of such person. Thereafter, Section 7 makes it clear that the person affected is person who holds such properties. As per sub-Section  1  of Section 7, the companypetent authority is required to determine whether the properties in question are illegally acquired properties by the person affected. Secondly, in a case where a person affected holds any property specified in the numberice through any other person after giving opportunity of hearing to such other person, the companypetent authority is required to determine whether all or any of the properties in question are illegally acquired properties. Sub-section  1  of Section 7 reads as under - Forfeiture of property in certain cases.  1  The companypetent authority may, after companysidering the explanation, if any, to the show-cause numberice issued under Section 6, and the materials available before it and after giving to the person affected  and in a case where the person affected holds any property specified in the numberice through any other person, to such other person also  a reasonable opportunity of being heard, by order, record a finding whether all or any of the properties in question are illegally acquired properties. From this sub-section it is clear that for the purpose of the Act, Section 7 categorises properties in two parts  1  properties held by the person affected and  2  the person affected holding the property through any other person. Further Section 12 deals with procedure for filing appeal before the Appellate Tribunal. Sub-section  4  provides that any person aggrieved by an order of the companypetent authority made under Section mentioned therein may, within forty-five days from the date on which the order is served on him, prefer an appeal to the appellate Tribunal. From the aforesaid scheme of the Act, any person aggrieved by an order of the companypetent authority would mean person whose property is held to be illegally acquired under the Act and which is to be forfeited or whose legal rights qua the said property are adversely affected. According to Blacks Law Dictionary, aggrieved party refers to a party whose personal, pecuniary or property rights have been adversely affected by another persons actions or by a companyrts decree or judgment.Also termed party aggrieved person aggrieved. Therefore, a relative or associate, who has numberinterest or right in such property can number be held to be a person aggrieved. It is true that wife may be aggrieved because her husbands properties are forfeited. But that would number companyfer a right to file an appeal against such order. There is numberinfringement of her legal right. For the purposes of the Act husband and wife are different entities. If the properties standing in the name of relative or associate are forfeited on the ground that smugglers or foreign exchange manipulators were holding the said properties in their names or that such properties are legally acquired, then to that extent, for challenging the said finding, the relative or associate can be held to be person aggrieved by the order of the companypetent authority. But, a relative or associate can number be companysidered to be aggrieved if the properties belonging to the smuggler of Foreign Exchange manipulator are forfeited under the Act. Learned companynsel for the appellant, however, submitted that Hindu wife would be having interest in her husbands property as she is having right of maintenance from her husbands property. For this purpose, learned companynsel referred to Sections 18, 23 and 27 of the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1956. Section 18 only provides that Hindu wife shall be entitled to be maintained by her husband during her life time and if she is staying separately as provided under sub-section  2 , she is entitled to claim maintenance from her husband. Section 23 deals with the determination of the amount of maintenance. Section 27 provides that dependants claim for maintenance under the Act shall number be a charge on the estate of the deceased or any portion thereof, unless one has been created by the will of the deceased, by a decree of companyrt, by agreement between the dependant and the owner of the estate or portion, or otherwise. Section 28 further provides that where a dependant has a right to receive maintenance out of the estate and if such estate is transferred, the right to receive maintenance may be enforced against the transferee, if the transferee has numberice of such right or if the transferee is gratuitous. At this stage, we would make it clear that the word dependant is defined under Section 21 to mean relatives of the deceased, namely,  1  his or her father  2  his or her mother  3  his widow, so long as she does number remarry but does number include the wife whose husband is surviving. In any case admittedly numbercharge for maintenance was created in favour of the appellant on the properties which are forfeited. She has number suffered any legal grievance and has numberlegal peg for a justiciable claim to hang on. Hence, there is numbersubstance in the companytention raised by the learned companynsel for the appellant. Before parting with the judgment, we would observe that it is difficult to companyprehend the reason for number including a person who is companyvicted under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 in the definition of Section 2 2  c  of the Act. It appears that for companytrolling the cancerous growth of companyruption apart from further deterrent provisions, illegally acquired properties by means of companyrupt practices companyld be forfeited under the provisions by suitable amendment in the Act. The question whether the time is ripe for such amendment or number is to be decided by the Legislature. However, we cannot turn our eyes to the fact that because of mad race of becoming rich and acquiring properties overnight or because of ostentatious or vulgar show of wealth by few or because of change of environment in the society by adoption of materialistic approach, cancerous growth of companyruption and illegal gains or profits has affected the moral standards of the people and all forms of governmental administration. It is to be mentioned that under the Indian Penal Code, various punishments are provided in Section 53 which include forfeiture of property and Sections 61 and 62 provided sentence of forfeiture of property. However, sections 61 and 62 were deleted by Indian Penal Code  Amendment  Act, 1921. But companysidering the situation prevailing in the society, it appears that the said provisions are required to be re-introduced so as to have deterrent effect on those who are bent upon to accumulate wealth at the companyt of the society by misusing their post or power.\",\n          \"REPORTABLE CIVIL APPEAL NO. 3317 OF 2008  Arising out of SLP  C  No.16359 of 2006  B. Sinha, J. Leave granted. Respondent No.2 was the owner of a Mini Bus. An insurance policy in respect of the said vehicle was sought to be taken by him. For the said purpose, the second respondent issued a third party cheque towards payment of insurance premium. The Development Officer of the appellant by inadvertence issued a companyer numbere. However, when the said mistake came to his numberice, the respondent No.2 was companytacted by the Development Officer. He was asked to pay the amount of premium. It was number tendered and in stead the respondent No.2 is said to have returned the original companyer numbere and took back the cheque. The original companyer numbere as also all the duplicate companyies thereof was cancelled. The said insurance companyer was issued for the period 3.9.1991 to 2.9.1992. On or about 12.9.1991, the said vehicle met with an accident. First respondent who suffered an injury therein filed a claim petition in terms of the provisions companytained in Section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988  the Act . An award for a sum of Rs.43,000/- was made. The Tribunal, in its award, categorically held The petitioners have produced Ex.P.7 the Xerox companyy of the companyer numbere Ex.R.1. There is all the chances of the owner of the vehicle having taken Xerox companyy of the companyer numbere Ex.R.1 and returning the original companyer numbere Ex.R.1 to the insurance companypany as deposed by RW.1. If really the companyer numbere was number cancelled, the original companyer numbere should have been with the insured and respondent No.3 companyld number have produced the original companyer numbere Ex.R.1. Hence, the case of 3rd respondent that the owner of the vehicle had given third party cheque and that later he had taken back the cheque and returned the original companyer numbere Ex.R.1 to the insurance companypany and that the insurance companypany has cancelled companyer numbere is more probable. As Ex.P.7 is the Xerox companyy of the original companyer numbere Ex.R.1 and as the original companyer numbere Ex.R.1 and its companyies Exs.R.2 to R.4 have been produced by the insurance companypany, the argument of the learned companynsel for the petitioners that respondent No.3 is liable to pay the companypensation cannot be accepted. Hence, from the above discussion, I hold that there was numbervalid insurance policy as on the date of the accident and as such the respondent No.3 is number liable to pay any companypensation to the petitioners. Second Respondent did number prefer any appeal thereagainst. Rirst Respondent only preferred an appeal questioning the quantum of companypensation. The High Court, by reason of the impugned judgment, while enhancing the amount of companypensation to a sum of Rs.1,50,000/-, held The above provision disclose that a policy can be issued against the issuance of cheque and the liability companymences from the date of issuance of cheque and number from the date of its encashment. There is numberprovision in law that the companysideration for policy should flow only from the insured and number from the third party. The development officer has acted in a hasty manner. No attempt was made to present the cheque for encashment. If the cheque was encashed it was well and good for the insurer otherwise steps companyld have been taken for cancellation of the policy Ex.R.1. The reason that the cheque is number issued by the insured is number a ground for valid cancellation. The endorsement of cancellation is vague, it does number bear the date. The officer who has made endorsement of cancellation is number examined. The endorsement of the insured is number taken on the policy to substantiate that the cancellation was with due numberice and knowledge by the insured. Therefore, under the above circumstances, the very cancellation of the policy for untenable reason is bad in law. The accident has occurred within 15 days from the date of issue of companyer numbere. Hence, the insurer is liable to pay the companypensation. Mr. Dua, learned companynsel appearing on behalf of the appellant, would submit that keeping in view the provisions companytained in Section 65 v  b  of the Insurance Act, 1938 and furthermore in view of the finding of fact arrived at by learned Motor Vehicles Accidents Claims Tribunal which was number questioned by the insured, the impugned judgment cannot be sustained. As numberody had appeared despite service of numberice on behalf of the respondent, we requested Mr. U.U. Lalit, senior companynsel to assist us. It is neither in doubt number in dispute that all the companyies including the insurance companyer which were marked as Ex.R.1 to R.4 had been produced before the Tribunal to show that original insurance companyer had been taken back by the Development Officer companycerned for one reason or the other. The Administrative Officer of the appellant number only examined himself before the Tribunal but also proved the numbere prepared by the Divisional Manager of Ludhiana which was marked as Ex.R.5. The Tribunal, as numbericed hereinbefore, on appreciation of the evidence produced before it, held that the vehicle was number legally insured. The High Court, however, wrongly proceeded on the premise that a cheque companyld be issued by a third party. A companytract of insurance like any other companytract, is a companytract between the insured and the insurer. The amount of premium is required to be paid as a companysideration for arriving at a companycluded companytract. If the insurer insists that a cheque should be issued only by the insured and number by a third party, numberexception thereto can be taken. The fact remains that the cheque was number encashed. Concededly, the insured did number make any payment. Section 64VB of the Insurance Act mandates that before a companytract of insurance companyes into being, the premium should be received by the insurer in advance, stating Section 64VB - No risk to be assumed unless premium is received in advance 1  No insurer shall assume any risk in India in respect of any insurance business on which premium is number ordinarily payable outside India unless and until the premium payable is received by him or is guaranteed to be paid by such person in such manner and within such time as may be prescribed or unless and until deposit of such amount as may be prescribed, is made in advance in the prescribed manner. For the purposes of this section, in the case of risks for which premium can be ascertained in advance, the risk may be assumed number earlier than the date on which the premium has been paid in cash or by cheque to the insurer. Explanation.Where the premium is tendered by postal money order or cheque sent by post, the risk may be assumed on the date on which the money order is booked or the cheque is posted, as the case may be. The question came up for companysideration recently before this Court in Deddaooa Ors. v. Branch Manager, National Insurance Co. Ltd.  2008  2 SCC 595, wherein upon numbericing the precedents which were operating in the field, it was clearly held The ratio of the said decision was, however, numbericed by this Court in New India Assurance Co. Ltd. v. Rula and Ors.  2003  3 SCC 195. It was held that ordinarily a liability under the companytract of insurance would arise only on payment of premium, if such payment was made a companydition precedent for taking effect of the insurance policy but such a companydition which is intended for the benefit of the insurer can be waived by it. It was opined 13If, on the date of accident, there was a policy of insurance in respect of the vehicle in question, the third party would have a claim against the Insurance Company and the owner of the vehicle would have to be indemnified in respect of the claim of that party. Subsequent cancellation of the insurance policy on the ground of number- payment of premium would number affect the rights already accrued in favour of the third party. The dicta laid down therein clarifies that if on the date of accident the policy subsists, then only the third party would be entitled to avail the benefit therof. Almost an identical question again came up for companysideration before this Court in National Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Seema Malhotra and Ors.  2001  3 SCC 151, a Division Bench numbericed both the aforementioned decisions and analysed the same in the light of Section 64-VB of the 1938 Act. It was held In a companytract of insurance when the insured gives a cheque towards payment of premium or part of the premium, such a companytract companysists of reciprocal promise. The drawer of the cheque promises the insurer that the cheque, on presentation, would yield the amount in cash. It cannot be forgotten that a cheque is a bill of exchange drawn on a specified banker. A bill of exchange is an instrument in writing companytaining an unconditional order directing a certain person to pay a certain sum of money to a certain person. It involves a promise that such money would be paid. Thus, when the insured fails to pay the premium promised, or when the cheque issued by him towards the premium is returned dishonoured by the bank companycerned the insurer need number perform his part of the promise. The companyollary is that the insured cannot claim performance from the insurer in such a situation. Under Section 25 of the Contract Act an agreement made without companysideration is void. Section 65 of the Contract Act says that when a companytract becomes void any person who has received any advantage under such companytract is bound to restore it to the person from whom he received it. So, even if the insurer has disbursed the amount companyered by the policy to the insured before the cheque was returned dishonoured, the insurer is entitled to get the money back. However, if the insured makes up the premium even after the cheque was dishonoured but before the date of accident it would be a different case as payment of companysideration can be treated as paid in the order in which the nature of transaction required it. As such an event did number happen in this case, the Insurance Company is legally justified in refusing to pay the amount claimed by the respondents. A companytract is based on reciprocal promise. Reciprocal promises by the parties are companydition precedents for a valid companytract. A companytract furthermore must be for companysideration. In todays world payment by cheque is ordinarily accepted as valid tender but the same would be subject to its encashment. A distinction, however, exists between the statutory liability of the insurance companypany vis- -vis the third party in terms of Sections 147 and 149 of the Motor Vehicles Act and its liability in other cases but it is clear that if the companytract of insurance had been cancelled and all companycerned had been intimated thereabout, the insurance companypany would number be liable to satisfy the claim. In this case, there cannot be any doubt or dispute whatsoever that numberprivity of companytract came into being between the appellant and the second respondent and as such the question of enforcing the purported companytract of insurance while taking recourse to Section 147 of the Motor Vehicles Act did number arise. Second respondent did number companytest the case at any stage. It did number adduce any evidence before the Tribunal. It does number appeal from the judgments of the High Court. No argument in the appeal was advanced in his behalf. Before us also, numberappearance has been made on behalf of the respondent No.2 despite service of numberice. The accident took place in the State of Karnataka. Respondent No.2 is a resident of Ludhiana. The transaction in question was purported to have been entered in Ludhiana.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"split\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"train\",\n          \"dev\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"name\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 34816,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"2008_1137.txt\",\n          \"1967_141.txt\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

This Appeal has been filed against the impugned judgment and order dated 25th July, 2007 passed by the High Court of Calcutta in C.R.A. No. 487 of 2004. The facts have been set out in the impugned judgment and hence we are number repeating the same here except wherever necessary. This is a case of brutal murder of a sex worker. Sex workers are also human beings and numberone has a right to assault or murder them. A person becomes a prostitute number because she enjoys it but because of poverty. Society must have sympathy towards the sex workers and must number look down upon them. They are also entitled to a life of dignity in view of Article 21 of the Constitution. In the numberels and stories of the great Bengali Writer Sharat Chand Chattopadhyaya, many prostitutes have been shown to be women of very high character, e.g., Rajyalakshmi in Shrikant, Chandramukhi in Devdas etc. -2- The plight of prostitutes has been depicted by the great Urdu poet Sahil Ludhianvi in his poem Chakle which has been sung in the Hindi film Pyasa Jineh Naaz Hai Hind Per wo kahan hain  simplified version of the verse Sana Khwan- e-taqdees-e-Mashrik Kahan Hain . We may also refer to the character Sonya Marmelodov in Dostoyevskys famous numberel Crime and Punishment. Sonya is depicted as a girl who sacrifices her body to earn some bread for her impoverished family. Reference may also be made to Amrapali, who was a companytemporary of Lord Buddha. In the present case, the incident happened on 17th September, 1999 at about 9.15 p.m. The deceased Chayay Rani Pal alias Buri was living in a red light area and was a resident of Room No.8 of Premises No.19, Jogen Dutta Lane in Calcutta. She was evidently a sex worker. The appellant Budhadev kicked her with fists and legs, and she fell down on the floor. The appellant then caught her by her hair and banged her head against the floor and the wall several times which left the victim bleeding from her ear, numbere and head. The incident was witnessed by four persons, Pw2-Abida, PW4- Maya, PW7-Asha and PW8-Parvati. PW2-Abida has deposed that she saw the appellant- accused catching the victim by her hair and banging her head against the wall. The victim was profusely bleeding through her numbere and mouth. On seeing this, Abida started shouting and then the accused pushed her and went down and fled away. PW8-Parvati saw the victim being mercilessly beaten by the -3- accused-appellant, and the same is the evidence of PW7-Asha. In the post mortem, as many as 11 injuries on the body of the victim were found, eight of which were on various parts of the face and forehead. The police was informed about the incident over the telephone as is evident from the testimony of PW2 Abida. After the police arrived on the spot, sample of the blood spilled from the body of the victim was companylected and photographs taken. The victim was brought by Asha Khatoon and others to the hospital where she was found dead on arrival. Blood was oozing out from her ear and numbertril. There was swelling on the left eyeball and left eyebrow. Thus, the medical evidence companyroborates the ocular testimony. PW10-Dr. Amitava Das, the Medical Officer who held the post mortem examination of the dead body of deceased Chhaya Rani Pal found the following injuries on her person Abrasion 1 x over the numbere just below the nasal bridge. Abrasion x over left side forehead above left eyebrow 3 left to midline. Abrasion x over left side of forehead just over the left eye brow 2 left mid line. Bruise 2 x 1 over left upper eye lid. Bruise 2 x 1 over anterior aspect of mid part of numbere. Abrasion x over right side of forehead 1 above right eye brow 2 right to mid line. Abrasion 2 x 1 over right side of face just below the right eye and just right to outer canthus of right eye. Lacerated wound x x scalp over left partial region 4 left to anterior mid line and 2 below left parietal eminence. -4- Abrasion 3 x over posteriorateral aspect of right forehead 1 below right elbow. Abrasion 1 x over anterior medial aspect of lower part of right forearm 1 above right wrist. Abrasion 4 x 3 over upper part of posterior aspect of right thigh 7 above right knee joint. On dissection, the Doctor found the following injuries Heamatoma 3 x 2 in the scalp tissue over right frontal region. Heamatoma 3 x 2 in the scalp tissue over left frontal region. Haematoma 3 x in the scalp tissue over left partial region. Fissured fracture 3 long more or loss longitudinal over left parietal temporal bone. Haematoma 2 x 1 in the scalp tissue over right parietal region. Subdural hemorrhage present involving the right parietal and temporal lobe. Lacerated wound  half  x x substance over right parietal lobe of brain substance. The abrasions were number-scabbed and red in companyour. The bruises were dark red in companyour.\",\n          \" Shah, J. LITTTTTTTJ Short question requiring companysideration in this appeal iswhether wife whose husbands property is ordered to be forfeited under the Smugglers And Foreign Exchange Manipulators  Forfeiture of Property  Act, 1976  hereinafter referred to as the SAFEMA  is entitled to file an appeal as person aggrieved under Section 12 4  of the Act? Before dealing with the companytentions, facts in nutshell are that the Government of India issued detention order dated 16.11.1995 under the Conservation of Foreign Exchange and Prevention of Smuggling Activities Act, 1974  hereinafter referred to as the COFEPOSA  against one Suresh Manoharlal Jumani, resident of Khar  West , Mumbai. It appears that the order of detention was number implemented as he was absconding. However, his detention order is neither revoked number quashed by any companyrt of companypetent jurisdiction. Thereafter, in exercise of powers companyferred under sub-section  1  of Section 6 of the SAFEMA, companypetent authority issued numberice dated 31.12.1996 to Suresh Manoharlal Jumani and his wife Smt. Shobha Suresh Jumani to show cause why the properties mentioned therein should number be declared to be illegally acquired properties and forfeited to the Central Government under the Act. The companypetent authority divided the properties in two parts 1  standing in the name of detenue i.e. properties mentioned as Items No.1 to 6 and  2  properties mentioned as Items No.7 and 8, which were standing in the name of appellant. Notice to the appellant was issued as two properties were standing in her name and as she was companysidered to be companyered by the provisions of Section 2 2  c  of the SAFEMA. After giving opportunity of hearing and of producing relevant material evidence, companypetent authority by order dated 23.8.1999 held that the properties mentioned therein stood forfeited to the Central Government under Section 7 of the SAFEMA free from all encumbrances. That order was challenged before the Appellate Tribunal for the forfeited property at New Delhi by filing appeal under Section 12. By order dated 5.1.2000, with regard to the forfeited property, i.e. Item Nos. 1 to 6 which were in the name of detenue, the Tribunal directed that as the detenue has number filed the appeal, the appeal was number maintainable and the companynsel should companyfine his arguments only in respect of Items No.7 and 8. The learned companynsel sought time for making his submission and the matter was adjourned to 4.2.2000. On 4.2.2000 the matter was heard qua Items No.7 and 8 which were standing in the name of the appellant and the appeal was dismissed on 8.2.2000. Thereafter, appellant preferred Miscellaneous Petition No. 17/Bom of 2000 in FPA No. 40/BOM/99 for reviewing the order on the ground that the appellant was having interest in Items No.1 to 6 as she had vested right of maintenance from her husband and his properties, and, therefore, she was person aggrieved. That companytention was negatived by the Tribunal by order dated 22.2.2000. The High Court of Bombay by order dated 6.2.2000 dismissed Crl. Writ Petition No. 653 of 2000 challenging the order passed by the Tribunal. Hence, this appeal. At the time of hearing of this matter, learned companynsel Mr. H.L. Tiku appearing on behalf of the appellant submitted that the order passed by the Tribunal is illegal and erroneous because any person aggrieved by an order of the companypetent authority is entitled to file an appeal under Section 12 4  of the SAFEMA and appellant being wife of the detenue is an aggrieved person. He also submitted that the appellant apart from being wife is also entitled to have charge for maintenance from the properties which are forfeited and, therefore, she is person aggrieved by the order of the companypetent authority. First we would reiterate that the words any aggrieved person are found in several statutes. However, the meaning of the expression aggrieved may vary according to the companytext of the enactment in which it appears and all the circumstances. In Sidebotham, Re, ex p Sidebotham  1880  14 Ch D 458, at page 465 , it was observed by James, L.J. But the words person aggrieved do number really mean a man who is disappointed of a benefit which he might have received if some other order had been made. A person aggrieved must be a man who has suffered a legal grievance, a man against whom a decision has been pronounced which has wrongfully deprived him of something or wrongfully refused him something, or wrongfully affected his title to something. The said passage was referred to and relied upon by this Court in Thammanna v. K. Veera Reddy,  1980  4 SCC 62 and Northern Plastics Ltd. v. Hindustan Photo Films Mfg. Co. Ltd. and Others,  1997  4 SCC 452. For deciding whether the appellant-wife companyld be said to be person aggrieved in companytext of the scheme and statutory provisions, we would refer to the objects and reasons of the Act and also relevant provisions. The Preamble of the SAFEMA reads thus - An Act to provide for the forfeiture of illegally acquired properties of smugglers and foreign exchange manipulators and for matters companynected therewith or incidental thereto. Whereas for the effective prevention of smuggling activities and foreign exchange manipulations which are having a deleterious effect on the national economy it is necessary to deprive persons engaged in such activities and manipulations of their ill-gotten gains And whereas such persons have been augmenting such gains by violations of wealth-tax, income-tax or other laws or by other means and have thereby been increasing their resources for operating in a clandestine manner And whereas such persons have in many cases been holding the properties acquired by them through such gains in the names of their relatives, associates and companyfidants.  Emphasis added  Whole emphasis in the Preamble is on the forfeiture of illegally acquired property by the smugglers and foreign exchange manipulators as such ill-gotten gains have a deleterious effect on the national economy. Further, even though such persons may be holding illegally acquired properties in the name of their relative, associates and companyfidence, such properties are also to be forfeited. Thereafter, Sub- section  1  of Section 2 provides that the Act would apply only to persons specified in sub-section  2 . Sub-section  2  categorises such persons as  a  person companyvicted under the Customs Act, Foreign Exchange Regulations Act, as stated therein, or  b  person against whom an order of detention has been made under COFEPOSA, or  c  person who is a relative of person referred to in clause  a  or  b , or  d  every associate of person referred to in clause  a  or  b , or  e  any holder of the property which was at any time previously held by a person referred to in clause  a  or clause  b  unless by purchase or in good faith for companysideration. Explanations II and III provides for the meaning of the words relative and associate respectively. Relative includes spouse of the person. At this stage, we would mention that there appears to be some mistake in omitting the persons who are companyvicted for the offence under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 even though, illegally acquired property is given exhaustive meaning under clause  c  of Section 3 1  of the Act to mean any property acquired by such person wholly or partly out of or by means of any income, earnings or assets derived or obtained from or attributable to any activity prohibited by or under any law for the time being in force relating to any matter of which Parliament has power to make laws. The definition gives further inclusive meaning with which we are number companycerned at present. Section 4 prohibits holding of illegally acquired property by providing it shall number be lawful for any person to whom this Act applies to hold any illegally acquired property either by himself or through any other person on his behalf. Sub- Section  2  provides that such property shall be liable to be forfeited to the Central Government in accordance with the provisions of the Act. The procedure is prescribed under Sections 6 and 7 of the Act. Section 6 provides for issuance of show cause numberice to such person who is holding illegally acquired properties. As stated above such person would be the person who is companyered by the inclusive definition under Section 2 2  c  of the Act. It also provides for issuance of numberice to the other person who holds the property on behalf of such person. Thereafter, Section 7 makes it clear that the person affected is person who holds such properties. As per sub-Section  1  of Section 7, the companypetent authority is required to determine whether the properties in question are illegally acquired properties by the person affected. Secondly, in a case where a person affected holds any property specified in the numberice through any other person after giving opportunity of hearing to such other person, the companypetent authority is required to determine whether all or any of the properties in question are illegally acquired properties. Sub-section  1  of Section 7 reads as under - Forfeiture of property in certain cases.  1  The companypetent authority may, after companysidering the explanation, if any, to the show-cause numberice issued under Section 6, and the materials available before it and after giving to the person affected  and in a case where the person affected holds any property specified in the numberice through any other person, to such other person also  a reasonable opportunity of being heard, by order, record a finding whether all or any of the properties in question are illegally acquired properties. From this sub-section it is clear that for the purpose of the Act, Section 7 categorises properties in two parts  1  properties held by the person affected and  2  the person affected holding the property through any other person. Further Section 12 deals with procedure for filing appeal before the Appellate Tribunal. Sub-section  4  provides that any person aggrieved by an order of the companypetent authority made under Section mentioned therein may, within forty-five days from the date on which the order is served on him, prefer an appeal to the appellate Tribunal. From the aforesaid scheme of the Act, any person aggrieved by an order of the companypetent authority would mean person whose property is held to be illegally acquired under the Act and which is to be forfeited or whose legal rights qua the said property are adversely affected. According to Blacks Law Dictionary, aggrieved party refers to a party whose personal, pecuniary or property rights have been adversely affected by another persons actions or by a companyrts decree or judgment.Also termed party aggrieved person aggrieved. Therefore, a relative or associate, who has numberinterest or right in such property can number be held to be a person aggrieved. It is true that wife may be aggrieved because her husbands properties are forfeited. But that would number companyfer a right to file an appeal against such order. There is numberinfringement of her legal right. For the purposes of the Act husband and wife are different entities. If the properties standing in the name of relative or associate are forfeited on the ground that smugglers or foreign exchange manipulators were holding the said properties in their names or that such properties are legally acquired, then to that extent, for challenging the said finding, the relative or associate can be held to be person aggrieved by the order of the companypetent authority. But, a relative or associate can number be companysidered to be aggrieved if the properties belonging to the smuggler of Foreign Exchange manipulator are forfeited under the Act. Learned companynsel for the appellant, however, submitted that Hindu wife would be having interest in her husbands property as she is having right of maintenance from her husbands property. For this purpose, learned companynsel referred to Sections 18, 23 and 27 of the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1956. Section 18 only provides that Hindu wife shall be entitled to be maintained by her husband during her life time and if she is staying separately as provided under sub-section  2 , she is entitled to claim maintenance from her husband. Section 23 deals with the determination of the amount of maintenance. Section 27 provides that dependants claim for maintenance under the Act shall number be a charge on the estate of the deceased or any portion thereof, unless one has been created by the will of the deceased, by a decree of companyrt, by agreement between the dependant and the owner of the estate or portion, or otherwise. Section 28 further provides that where a dependant has a right to receive maintenance out of the estate and if such estate is transferred, the right to receive maintenance may be enforced against the transferee, if the transferee has numberice of such right or if the transferee is gratuitous. At this stage, we would make it clear that the word dependant is defined under Section 21 to mean relatives of the deceased, namely,  1  his or her father  2  his or her mother  3  his widow, so long as she does number remarry but does number include the wife whose husband is surviving. In any case admittedly numbercharge for maintenance was created in favour of the appellant on the properties which are forfeited. She has number suffered any legal grievance and has numberlegal peg for a justiciable claim to hang on. Hence, there is numbersubstance in the companytention raised by the learned companynsel for the appellant. Before parting with the judgment, we would observe that it is difficult to companyprehend the reason for number including a person who is companyvicted under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 in the definition of Section 2 2  c  of the Act. It appears that for companytrolling the cancerous growth of companyruption apart from further deterrent provisions, illegally acquired properties by means of companyrupt practices companyld be forfeited under the provisions by suitable amendment in the Act. The question whether the time is ripe for such amendment or number is to be decided by the Legislature. However, we cannot turn our eyes to the fact that because of mad race of becoming rich and acquiring properties overnight or because of ostentatious or vulgar show of wealth by few or because of change of environment in the society by adoption of materialistic approach, cancerous growth of companyruption and illegal gains or profits has affected the moral standards of the people and all forms of governmental administration. It is to be mentioned that under the Indian Penal Code, various punishments are provided in Section 53 which include forfeiture of property and Sections 61 and 62 provided sentence of forfeiture of property. However, sections 61 and 62 were deleted by Indian Penal Code  Amendment  Act, 1921. But companysidering the situation prevailing in the society, it appears that the said provisions are required to be re-introduced so as to have deterrent effect on those who are bent upon to accumulate wealth at the companyt of the society by misusing their post or power.\",\n          \"REPORTABLE CIVIL APPEAL NO. 3317 OF 2008  Arising out of SLP  C  No.16359 of 2006  B. Sinha, J. Leave granted. Respondent No.2 was the owner of a Mini Bus. An insurance policy in respect of the said vehicle was sought to be taken by him. For the said purpose, the second respondent issued a third party cheque towards payment of insurance premium. The Development Officer of the appellant by inadvertence issued a companyer numbere. However, when the said mistake came to his numberice, the respondent No.2 was companytacted by the Development Officer. He was asked to pay the amount of premium. It was number tendered and in stead the respondent No.2 is said to have returned the original companyer numbere and took back the cheque. The original companyer numbere as also all the duplicate companyies thereof was cancelled. The said insurance companyer was issued for the period 3.9.1991 to 2.9.1992. On or about 12.9.1991, the said vehicle met with an accident. First respondent who suffered an injury therein filed a claim petition in terms of the provisions companytained in Section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988  the Act . An award for a sum of Rs.43,000/- was made. The Tribunal, in its award, categorically held The petitioners have produced Ex.P.7 the Xerox companyy of the companyer numbere Ex.R.1. There is all the chances of the owner of the vehicle having taken Xerox companyy of the companyer numbere Ex.R.1 and returning the original companyer numbere Ex.R.1 to the insurance companypany as deposed by RW.1. If really the companyer numbere was number cancelled, the original companyer numbere should have been with the insured and respondent No.3 companyld number have produced the original companyer numbere Ex.R.1. Hence, the case of 3rd respondent that the owner of the vehicle had given third party cheque and that later he had taken back the cheque and returned the original companyer numbere Ex.R.1 to the insurance companypany and that the insurance companypany has cancelled companyer numbere is more probable. As Ex.P.7 is the Xerox companyy of the original companyer numbere Ex.R.1 and as the original companyer numbere Ex.R.1 and its companyies Exs.R.2 to R.4 have been produced by the insurance companypany, the argument of the learned companynsel for the petitioners that respondent No.3 is liable to pay the companypensation cannot be accepted. Hence, from the above discussion, I hold that there was numbervalid insurance policy as on the date of the accident and as such the respondent No.3 is number liable to pay any companypensation to the petitioners. Second Respondent did number prefer any appeal thereagainst. Rirst Respondent only preferred an appeal questioning the quantum of companypensation. The High Court, by reason of the impugned judgment, while enhancing the amount of companypensation to a sum of Rs.1,50,000/-, held The above provision disclose that a policy can be issued against the issuance of cheque and the liability companymences from the date of issuance of cheque and number from the date of its encashment. There is numberprovision in law that the companysideration for policy should flow only from the insured and number from the third party. The development officer has acted in a hasty manner. No attempt was made to present the cheque for encashment. If the cheque was encashed it was well and good for the insurer otherwise steps companyld have been taken for cancellation of the policy Ex.R.1. The reason that the cheque is number issued by the insured is number a ground for valid cancellation. The endorsement of cancellation is vague, it does number bear the date. The officer who has made endorsement of cancellation is number examined. The endorsement of the insured is number taken on the policy to substantiate that the cancellation was with due numberice and knowledge by the insured. Therefore, under the above circumstances, the very cancellation of the policy for untenable reason is bad in law. The accident has occurred within 15 days from the date of issue of companyer numbere. Hence, the insurer is liable to pay the companypensation. Mr. Dua, learned companynsel appearing on behalf of the appellant, would submit that keeping in view the provisions companytained in Section 65 v  b  of the Insurance Act, 1938 and furthermore in view of the finding of fact arrived at by learned Motor Vehicles Accidents Claims Tribunal which was number questioned by the insured, the impugned judgment cannot be sustained. As numberody had appeared despite service of numberice on behalf of the respondent, we requested Mr. U.U. Lalit, senior companynsel to assist us. It is neither in doubt number in dispute that all the companyies including the insurance companyer which were marked as Ex.R.1 to R.4 had been produced before the Tribunal to show that original insurance companyer had been taken back by the Development Officer companycerned for one reason or the other. The Administrative Officer of the appellant number only examined himself before the Tribunal but also proved the numbere prepared by the Divisional Manager of Ludhiana which was marked as Ex.R.5. The Tribunal, as numbericed hereinbefore, on appreciation of the evidence produced before it, held that the vehicle was number legally insured. The High Court, however, wrongly proceeded on the premise that a cheque companyld be issued by a third party. A companytract of insurance like any other companytract, is a companytract between the insured and the insurer. The amount of premium is required to be paid as a companysideration for arriving at a companycluded companytract. If the insurer insists that a cheque should be issued only by the insured and number by a third party, numberexception thereto can be taken. The fact remains that the cheque was number encashed. Concededly, the insured did number make any payment. Section 64VB of the Insurance Act mandates that before a companytract of insurance companyes into being, the premium should be received by the insurer in advance, stating Section 64VB - No risk to be assumed unless premium is received in advance 1  No insurer shall assume any risk in India in respect of any insurance business on which premium is number ordinarily payable outside India unless and until the premium payable is received by him or is guaranteed to be paid by such person in such manner and within such time as may be prescribed or unless and until deposit of such amount as may be prescribed, is made in advance in the prescribed manner. For the purposes of this section, in the case of risks for which premium can be ascertained in advance, the risk may be assumed number earlier than the date on which the premium has been paid in cash or by cheque to the insurer. Explanation.Where the premium is tendered by postal money order or cheque sent by post, the risk may be assumed on the date on which the money order is booked or the cheque is posted, as the case may be. The question came up for companysideration recently before this Court in Deddaooa Ors. v. Branch Manager, National Insurance Co. Ltd.  2008  2 SCC 595, wherein upon numbericing the precedents which were operating in the field, it was clearly held The ratio of the said decision was, however, numbericed by this Court in New India Assurance Co. Ltd. v. Rula and Ors.  2003  3 SCC 195. It was held that ordinarily a liability under the companytract of insurance would arise only on payment of premium, if such payment was made a companydition precedent for taking effect of the insurance policy but such a companydition which is intended for the benefit of the insurer can be waived by it. It was opined 13If, on the date of accident, there was a policy of insurance in respect of the vehicle in question, the third party would have a claim against the Insurance Company and the owner of the vehicle would have to be indemnified in respect of the claim of that party. Subsequent cancellation of the insurance policy on the ground of number- payment of premium would number affect the rights already accrued in favour of the third party. The dicta laid down therein clarifies that if on the date of accident the policy subsists, then only the third party would be entitled to avail the benefit therof. Almost an identical question again came up for companysideration before this Court in National Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Seema Malhotra and Ors.  2001  3 SCC 151, a Division Bench numbericed both the aforementioned decisions and analysed the same in the light of Section 64-VB of the 1938 Act. It was held In a companytract of insurance when the insured gives a cheque towards payment of premium or part of the premium, such a companytract companysists of reciprocal promise. The drawer of the cheque promises the insurer that the cheque, on presentation, would yield the amount in cash. It cannot be forgotten that a cheque is a bill of exchange drawn on a specified banker. A bill of exchange is an instrument in writing companytaining an unconditional order directing a certain person to pay a certain sum of money to a certain person. It involves a promise that such money would be paid. Thus, when the insured fails to pay the premium promised, or when the cheque issued by him towards the premium is returned dishonoured by the bank companycerned the insurer need number perform his part of the promise. The companyollary is that the insured cannot claim performance from the insurer in such a situation. Under Section 25 of the Contract Act an agreement made without companysideration is void. Section 65 of the Contract Act says that when a companytract becomes void any person who has received any advantage under such companytract is bound to restore it to the person from whom he received it. So, even if the insurer has disbursed the amount companyered by the policy to the insured before the cheque was returned dishonoured, the insurer is entitled to get the money back. However, if the insured makes up the premium even after the cheque was dishonoured but before the date of accident it would be a different case as payment of companysideration can be treated as paid in the order in which the nature of transaction required it. As such an event did number happen in this case, the Insurance Company is legally justified in refusing to pay the amount claimed by the respondents. A companytract is based on reciprocal promise. Reciprocal promises by the parties are companydition precedents for a valid companytract. A companytract furthermore must be for companysideration. In todays world payment by cheque is ordinarily accepted as valid tender but the same would be subject to its encashment. A distinction, however, exists between the statutory liability of the insurance companypany vis- -vis the third party in terms of Sections 147 and 149 of the Motor Vehicles Act and its liability in other cases but it is clear that if the companytract of insurance had been cancelled and all companycerned had been intimated thereabout, the insurance companypany would number be liable to satisfy the claim. In this case, there cannot be any doubt or dispute whatsoever that numberprivity of companytract came into being between the appellant and the second respondent and as such the question of enforcing the purported companytract of insurance while taking recourse to Section 147 of the Motor Vehicles Act did number arise. Second respondent did number companytest the case at any stage. It did number adduce any evidence before the Tribunal. It does number appeal from the judgments of the High Court. No argument in the appeal was advanced in his behalf. Before us also, numberappearance has been made on behalf of the respondent No.2 despite service of numberice. The accident took place in the State of Karnataka. Respondent No.2 is a resident of Ludhiana. The transaction in question was purported to have been entered in Ludhiana.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"text_id\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 10050,\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 34816,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 34816,\n        \"samples\": [\n          8239,\n          19982,\n          22380\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Upon receipt of proposal from the Development Authority for acquisition of 205.0288 hectares land of village Makora, Pargana Dankaur, Tehsil and District Gautam Budh Nagar, which was approved by the State Government, numberification dated 12.3.2008 was issued under Section 4 1  read with Section 17 1  and 17 4  of the Act. The relevant portions of the numberification are extracted below Under Sub-Section  1  of Section 4 of the Land Acquisition Act 1894  Act number1 of 1894 , the Governor is pleased to numberify for general information that the land mentioned in the scheduled below, is needed for public purpose, namely planned industrial development in District Gautam Budh Nagar through Greater Noida Industrial Development Authority. The Governor being of the opinion that the provisions of sub-section 1 of Section 17 of the said Act, are applicable to said land inasmuch as the said land is urgently required, for the planned industrial development in District Gautam Budh Nagar through Greater Noida Industrial Development Authority and it is as well necessary to eliminate the delay likely to be caused by an enquiry under Section 5A of the said Act, the Governor is further pleased to direct under sub-section 4 of Section 17 of the said Act that the provisions of Section 5A of the said Act, shall number apply. Since the appellants land was also included in the numberification, they made a representation to the Chairman-cum-Chief Executive Officer of the Development Authority  Respondent No.4  with companyies to the Chief Minister, Principal Secretary, Housing and Urban Development, U.P., the District Magistrate and the Special Officer, Land Acquisition, Gautam Buddh Nagar with the request that their land companyprised in Khasra No.394 may number be acquired because they had raised companystruction 30-35 years ago and were using the property for abadi habitation. The companycerned functionaries authorities did number pay heed to the request of the appellants and the State Government issued numberification dated 19.11.2008 under Section 6 read with Section 9 of the Act. The appellants challenged the acquisition of their land on several grounds including the following That the land cannot be used for industrial purposes because in the draft Master Plan of Greater NOIDA  2021 , the same is shown as part of residential zone. That they had already companystructed dwelling houses and as per the policy of the State Government, the residential structures are exempted from acquisition. That the State Government arbitrarily invoked Section 17 1  read with Section 17 4  of the Act and deprived them of their valuable right to raise objections under Section 5-A. The acquisition of land is vitiated by arbitrariness, mala fides and violation of Article 14 of the Constitution inasmuch as lands of the Member of Legislative Assembly and other influential persons were left out from acquisition despite the fact that they were number in abadi, but they were number given similar treatment despite the fact that their land was part of abadi and they had companystructed dwelling units. In support of their challenge to the invoking of Section 17 1  and  4 , the appellants made detailed averments in paragraphs 11 and 16 and raised specific grounds A and F, which are extracted below That as per the scheme of the said Act, each and every section from sections 4 to 17 has an independent role to play though there is an element of interaction between them. Section 5-A, has a very important role to play in the acquisition proceedings and it is mandatory of the part of the government to give hearing to the person interested in the land whose land is sought to be acquired. It is relevant to point out that the acquisition proceedings under the Act, are based on the principal of eminent domain and the only protection given to the person whose land is sought to be acquired is an opportunity under Section 5-A of the Act to companyvince the enquiring authority that the purpose for which the land is sought to be acquired is in fact is number a public purpose and is only purported to be one in the guise of a public purpose. It is relevant to mention here that excluding the enquiry under Section 5-A can only be an exception where the urgency cannot brook any delay. The enquiry provides an opportunity to the owner of land to companyvince the authorities companycerned that the land in question is number suitable for purpose for which it is sought to be acquired or the same sought to be acquired for the companylateral purposes. It is pertinent to mention here that the respondents No. 1 2 without the application of mind dispensed with the enquiry on the ground of urgency invoking the power companyferred by Section 17  1  or  2  of the Act. Further, the respondent No. 1 2 without application of mind did number companysidered the survey report of the abadi of the village Makaura where the entire land is being used for the purpose of residence and grazing of cattles in Khasra No. 394. Further, the petitioners were surprised to find that their land have number been included in the Abadi irrespective the same is in use for habitable and keeping the cattle and other uses. The petitioners have companystructed their houses and using the same for their residence and keep their cattles and agricultural produce. The survey report clearly shows that the impugned Khasra No. 394 is in use for residence. The report in respect of the land in question falling in Khasra No. 394 given by the respondent No. 4 vide companymunication dated 26th March, 2007 is annexed as Annexure 6. That the said numberification under Section 4 of the Act issued by the respondent No. 1 and 2 is without application of mind and there was numberurgency in the acquisition of land, for the planned industrial development, as the land, as per the master plan - 2021 the land of the village Makaura is reserved for residential of which the respondent No. 2 invoked Section 17  1  and subsection 4 of the Act by dispensing with an enquiry under Section 5A of the Act. The said action on the part of the respondents are un-warranted and is in gross violation of Article 14,19, 21 and 300A of the companystitution. The such illegal act on the part of the respondents show mala fide and their oblique motive to deprive the owners from their houses in order to fulfill their political obligations promise to the private builders by taking the shelter of section 17 of the Act by dispensing with the enquiry under Section 5-A of the Act as well as overlooked purpose as stipulated in the Master Plan 2021 which is any way do number require any urgent attention. That the whole acquisition proceedings are void, unconstitutional, tainted with mala fide, abuse of authority and power, number-application of mind, and as such, liable to be quashed as violative of Articles 14,19 and 300-A of the Constitution of India. That the purpose stated in the numberification under Section 4 and declaration under section 6 by invoking section 17 is presently number-existent and thus the numberification is bad in law. There is numberurgency for the invocation when the land is to be acquired for planned development for the purpose of setting residential companyony. The impugned numberification is without any authority of law and volatile of Article 300-A of the Constitution of India, which limits the power to acquire land to the authority under the Land Acquisition Act. Therefore, the numberification in question is bad in law.  emphasis supplied  The High Court negatived the appellants challenge at the threshold mainly on the ground that the averments companytained in the petition were number supported by a proper affidavit. This is evident from the following portions of the impugned order Here the petitioners neither have pleaded that there exist numbermaterial before the State Government to companye to the companyclusion that the enquiry under Section 5-A should be dispensed with by invoking Section 17 4  of the Act number the learned companynsel for the petitioners companyld place before us any such averment in the writ petition. Though, in para-11 of the writ petition, an averment has been made that the respondents number 1 and 2 without the application of mind dispensed with the enquiry on the ground of urgency invoking the power companyferred by Section 17 1  or  2  of the Act, but in the affidavit, the said paragraph has been sworn on the basis of perusal of record. Similarly in para 16 of the writ petition, the only averment companytained therein is as under That the said numberification under Section 4 of the Act issued by the respondent No.1 and 2 is without application of mind and there was numberurgency in the acquisition of land, for the planned industrial development, as the land, as per the master plan-2021 the land of the village Makaura is reserved for residential of which the respondent No.2 invoked Section 17 1  and sub-section 4 of the Act by dispensing with an enquiry under Section 5-A of the Act. The said action on the part of the respondents are un-warranted and is in gross violation of Article 14,19,21 and 300A of the Constitution. The such illegal act on the part of the respondents show mala fide and their oblique motive to deprive the owners from their houses in order to fulfill their political obligations promise to the private builders by taking the shelter of Section 17 of the Act by dispensing with the enquiry under Section 5-A of the Act as well as overlooked purpose as stipulated in the Master Plan 2021 which is any way do number require any urgent attention. However, in the affidavit, this para has number been sworn at all and in any case with respect to dispensation of enquiry under Section 5-A by invoking Section 17 4  of the Act numberhing has been said except that the exercise of power is violative of Articles 14,19, 21 and 300-A of the Constitution. We, therefore, do number find any occasion even to call upon the respondents to file a companynter affidavit placing on record, the material if any for exercising power under Section 17 1  and  4  of the Act in the absence of any relevant pleading or material and the question of requiring the respondents to produce the original record in this regard also does number arise. The High Court distinguished the judgment of this Court in Om Prakash v. State of U.P.  1998  6 SCC 1, albeit without assigning any companyent reason, relied upon the judgments of the Division Benches in Kshama Sahkari Avas Samiti Ltd. v. State of U.P. 2007  1  AWC 327, Jasraj Singh v. State of U.P. 2008  8  ADJ 329 and Jagriti Sahkari Avas Samiti Ltd. Ghaziabad v. State of U.P. 2008  9  ADJ 43 and held that the decision of the Government to invoke Section 17 1  cannot be subjected to judicial review. The High Court also rejected the appellants plea that in terms of the policy framed by the State Government, the land companyered by abadi cannot be acquired by observing that numbermaterial has been placed on record to show that the policy framed in 1991 was still companytinuing. To buttress this companyclusion, the High Court relied upon the judgment of this Court in Anand Buttons Limited v. State of Haryana  2005  9 SCC 164. By an order dated 29.10.2010, this Court, after taking companynizance of the fact that the respondents did number get opportunity to file reply to the writ petition, directed them to do so. Thereupon, Shri Harnam Singh, Additional District Magistrate  Land Acquisition  Officer on Special Duty  Land Acquisition  NOIDA, District Gautam Budh Nagar filed companynter affidavit on behalf of respondent Nos.1 to 3. In paragraph 10 of his affidavit, Shri Harnam Singh has attempted to justify invoking of the urgency clause by making the following assertions That in invoking the urgency clause the State Government has taken into companysideration the following factors- Greater Noida Industrial Development Authority was companystituted under the U.P. Industrial Area Development Act, 1976 to promote Industrial and Urban Development in the Area. The acquired land was urgently required by the Development Authority for planned Industrial Development of the area. ii  That the land in the adjoining villages were already acquired by the Greater Noida Industrial Development Authority. Thus, the acquired land was urgently required for companytinuity of infrastructure services and planned Industrial Development of the Area. If, the proposed land was number acquired immediately and delay in this regard would lead to encroachments and would adversely affect the Planned Industrial Development of the Area. iii  That the acquired land was required for overall development i.e. companystruction of roads, laying of sewerages, providing electricity etc. in the area and the said scheme has been duly approved by the state government. iv  That the acquired land companysists of 246 plots numbers with 392 recorded tenure holders. If objections are to be invited and hearing be given to such large number of tenure holders, it would take long time to dispose of the objections thereof and would hamper the planned development of the area. That reputed industrial houses who are interested in investing in the State and in case the land is number readily available, they might move to other states and such a move would adversely affect the employment opportunities in the State. Shri Harnam Singh also companytroverted the appellants plea for exemption by stating that the companystructions made by them on land of Khasra Nos.101 and 399 were insignificant and the companystruction raised on Khasra No.394 is number part of village Abadi. Shri Manoj Kumar Singh, Tehsildar filed a separate affidavit on behalf of Respondent No.4 and justified the invoking of urgency clause by asserting that large tracts of land were acquired for industrial development of the district. According to him, as per the policy of industrial development of the State Government, the land is required to be allotted to industrial houses. On 8.11.2010, Shri Dinesh Dwivedi learned senior companynsel for the State made a request for permission to file additional affidavit with some documents. His request was accepted. Thereafter, the respondents filed an affidavit of Shri Sushil Kumar Chaubey, Tehsildar, Land Acquisition, Gautam Budh Nagar along with eight documents of which seven have been companylectively marked as Annexure A-1. The first of the documents marked Annexure A-1 is companyy of letter dated 25.2.2008 sent by the Commissioner and Director, Directorate of Land Acquisition, Revenue Board, U.P. to the Special Secretary, Industrial Development on the subject of issuance of numberification under Sections 4 and 17 of the Act for acquisition of lands measuring 205.0288 hectares of village Makora. The second document is an undated letter signed by Deputy Chief Executive Officer, Greater Noida, Collector, Gautam Budh Nagar and four other officers officials. The next document has been described as companyments certificate on the issues raised in Government Order No.5261/77-4-06-251N/06 dated 21.12.2006 with regard to proposal for acquisition of 205.0288 hectares lands in village Makora. This document is accompanied by seven forms companytaining various particulars. The third document is companymunication dated 29.10.2007 sent by the Commissioner, Meerut Division, Meerut to the District Magistrate, Gautam Budh Nagar companyveying the companysent of the Divisional Land Utility Committee for the acquisition of lands of five villages including Makora. This letter is accompanied by minutes of the meeting of the Divisional Land Utility Committee held on 29.10.2007. The fifth document is form No.43A- The sixth document is companymunication dated 22.2.2008 sent by Collector, Land Acquisition Special Land Acquisition Officer, Greater Noida. The last document which forms part of Annexure A-1 is form No.16 showing the list of properties having companystructions etc. Annexure A-2 is companyy of letter dated 31.10.2008 sent by the Director, Directorate of Land Acquisition to the Special Secretary, Industrial Development. Shri N.P.Singh, learned companynsel for the appellants argued that the impugned order is liable to be set aside because the High Court failed to companysider the issues raised in the writ petition in a companyrect perspective. Learned companynsel submitted that the appellants had specifically pleaded that there was numbervalid ground to invoke the urgency clause companytained in Section 17 1  and to dispense with the application of Section 5-A but the High Court did number even call upon the respondents to file companynter affidavit and brushed aside the challenge to the acquisition proceeding on a wholly untenable premise that the affidavit filed in support of the writ petition was laconic. Learned companynsel further argued that the purpose for which land was acquired i.e. planned industrial development of the district did number justify invoking of the urgency provisions and denial of opportunity to the appellants and other land owners to file objections under Section 5-A  1  and to be heard by the Collector in terms of the mandate of Section 5-A  2 . In support of his argument, learned companynsel relied upon the judgments in Narayan Govind Gavate v. State of Maharashtra  1977  1 SCC 133 and Esso Fabs Private Limited v. State of Haryana  2009  2 SCC 377. Another argument of the learned companynsel is that the High Court misdirected itself in summarily dismissing the writ petition ignoring the substantive plea of discrimination raised by the appellants. Shri Dinesh Dwivedi, learned senior companynsel appearing for the respondents urged that this Court should number nullify the acquisition at the instance of the appellants because the pleadings filed before the High Court were number supported by proper affidavit. Shri Dwivedi argued that the High Court was justified in number-suiting the appellants because they did number produce any evidence to effectively challenge the invoking of urgency provision companytained in Section 17 1 . Learned senior companynsel emphasized that the satisfaction envisaged in Section 17 1  is purely subjective and the Court cannot review the decision taken by the State Government to invoke the urgency clause. He submitted that planned industrial development of District Gautam Budh Nagar is being undertaken in companysonance with the policy decision taken by the State Government and the appellants cannot be heard to make a grievance against the acquisition of their land because they will be duly companypensated. In support of his argument, Shri Dwivedi relied upon the judgment of this Court in State of U.P. v. Pista Devi  1986  4 SCC 251 and Chameli Singh v. State of U.P.  1996  2 SCC 549. Learned senior companynsel further submitted that the appellants land cannot be released from acquisition because that will result in frustrating the objective of planned industrial development of the district. On the issue of discrimination, Shri Dwivedi argued that even if the land belonging to some persons has been illegally left out from acquisition, the appellants are number entitled to a direction that their land should also be released. The first issue which needs to be addressed is whether the High Court was justified in number-suiting the appellants on the ground that they had number raised a specific plea supported by a proper affidavit to question the decision taken by the State Government to invoke Section 17 1  and 17 4  of the Act. We shall also companysider an ancillary issue as to whether the appellants had succeeded in prima facie proving that there was numberjustification to invoke the urgency clause and to dispense with the inquiry envisaged under Section 5-A. At the outset, we record our disapproval of the casual manner in which the High Court disposed of the writ petition without even calling upon the respondents to file companynter affidavit and produce the relevant records. A reading of the averments companytained in paragraphs 11 and 16 and grounds A and F of the writ petition, which have been extracted hereinabove companypled with the appellants assertion that the acquisition of their land was vitiated due to discrimination inasmuch as land belonging to influential persons had been left out from acquisition, but their land was acquired in total disregard of the policy of the State Government to leave out land on which dwelling units had already been companystructed, show that they had succeeded in making out a strong case for deeper examination of the issues raised in the writ petition and the High Court companymitted serious error by summarily number- suiting them. The history of land acquisition legislations shows that in Eighteenth Century, Bengal Regulation I of 1824, Act I of 1850, Act VI of 1857, Act XXII of 1863, Act X of 1870, Bombay Act No. XXVIII of 1839, Bombay Act No. XVII of 1850, Madras Act No. XX of 1852 and Madras Act No.1 of 1854 were enacted to facilitate the acquisition of land and other immovable properties for roads, canals, and other public purposes by paying the amount to be determined by the arbitrators. In 1870, the Land Acquisition Act was enacted to provide for proper valuation of the acquired land. That Act envisaged that if the person having interest in land is number agreeable to part with possession by accepting the amount offered to him, then the Collector may make a reference to the Civil Court. The 1870 Act also envisaged appointment of assessors to assist the Civil Court. If the Court and the assessor did number agree on the amount then an appeal companyld be filed in the High Court. This mechanism proved ineffective because lot of time was companysumed in litigation. With a view to overcome this problem, the legislature enacted the Act on the line of the English Lands Clauses Consolidation Act, 1845. However, the land owners or persons having interest in land did number have any say in the acquisition process either under pre-1984 legislations or the 1984 Act  un-amended . They companyld raise objection only qua the amount of companypensation and matters companynected therewith. The absence of opportunity to raise objection against the acquisition of land was resented by those who were deprived of their land. To redress this grievance, Section 5A was inserted in the Act by amending Act No.38 of 1923. The statement of Objects and Reasons companytained in Bill No.29 of 1923, which led to enactment of the amending Act read as under The Land Acquisition Act I of 1894 does number provide that persons having an interest in land which it is proposed to acquire, shall have the right of objecting to such acquisition number is Government bound to enquire into and companysider any objections that may reach them. The object of this Bill is to provide that a Local Government shall number declare, under Section 6 of the Act, that any land is needed for a public purpose unless time has been allowed after the numberification under Section 4 for persons interested in the land to put in objections and for such objections to be companysidered by the Local Government. The Act, which was enacted more than 116 years ago for facilitating the acquisition of land and other immovable properties for companystruction of roads, canals, railways etc., has been frequently used in the post independence era for different public purposes like laying of roads, companystruction of bridges, dams and buildings of various public establishments institutions, planned development of urban areas, providing of houses to different sections of the society and for developing residential companyonies sectors. However, in the recent years, the companyntry has witnessed a new phenomena. Large tracts of land have been acquired in rural parts of the companyntry in the name of development and transferred to private entrepreneurs, who have utilized the same for companystruction of multi-storied companyplexes, companymercial centers and for setting up industrial units. Similarly, large scale acquisitions have been made on behalf of the companypanies by invoking the provisions companytained in Part VII of the Act. The resultant effect of these acquisitions is that the land owners, who were doing agricultural operations and other ancillary activities in rural areas, have been deprived of the only source of their livelihood. Majority of them do number have any idea about their companystitutional and legal rights, which can be enforced by availing the companystitutional remedies under Articles 32 and 226 of the Constitution. They reconcile with deprivation of land by accepting the amount of companypensation offered by the Government and by thinking that it is their fate and destiny determined by God. Even those who get semblance of education are neither companyversant with the functioning of the State apparatus number they can access the records prepared by the companycerned authorities as a prelude to the acquisition of land by invoking Section 4 with or without the aid of Section 17 1  and or 17 4 . Therefore, while examining the land owners challenge to the acquisition of land in a petition filed under Article 226 of the Constitution, the High Court should number adopt a pedantic approach, as has been done in the present case, and decide the matter keeping in view the companystitutional goals of social and economic justice and the fact that even though the right to property is numberlonger a fundamental right, the same companytinues to be an important companystitutional right and in terms of Article 300-A, numberperson can be deprived of his property except by authority of law. In cases where the acquisition is made by invoking Section 4 read with Section 17 1  and or 17 4 , the High Court should insist upon filing of reply affidavit by the respondents and production of the relevant records and carefully scrutinize the same before pronouncing upon legality of the impugned numberification action because a negative result without examining the relevant records to find out whether the companypetent authority had formed a bona fide opinion on the issue of invoking the urgency provision and excluding the application of Section 5-A is likely to make the land owner a landless poor and force him to migrate to the nearby city only to live in a slum. A departure from this rule should be made only when land is required to meet really emergent situations like those enumerated in Section 17 2 . If the acquisition is intended to benefit private person s  and the provisions companytained in Section 17 1  and or 17 4  are invoked, then scrutiny of the justification put forward by the State should be more rigorous in cases involving the challenge to the acquisition of land, the pleadings should be liberally companystrued and relief should number be denied to the petitioner by applying the technical rules of procedure embodied in the Code of Civil Procedure and other procedural laws. In this companytext it will be profitable to numberice the observations made by this Court in Authorised Officer, Thanjavur v. S Naganatha Ayyar  1979  3 SCC 466, which are as under It is true that Judges are companystitutional invigilators and statutory interpreters but they are also responsive and responsible to Part IV of the Constitution being one of the trinity of the nations appointed instrumentalities in the transformation of the socio-economic order. The judiciary, in its sphere, shares the revolutionary purpose of the companystitutional order, and when called upon to decode social legislation must be animated by a goal- oriented approach. This is part of the dynamics of statutory interpretation in the developing companyntries so that companyrts are number companyverted into rescue shelters for those who seek to defeat agrarian justice by cute transactions of many manifestations number so familiar in the companyntry and illustrated by the several cases under appeal. This caveat has become necessary because the judiciary is number a mere umpire, as some assume, but an activist catalyst in the companystitutional scheme. We may number advert to the ancillary question whether the High Court was justified in number suiting the appellants on the ground that they failed to discharge the primary burden of proving that the State Government had invoked Section 17 1  and 17 4  without application of mind to the relevant companysiderations. In this companytext, it is apposite to observe that while dealing with challenge to the acquisition of land belonging to those who suffer from handicaps of poverty, illiteracy and ignorance and do number have the resources to access the material relied upon by the functionaries of the State and its agencies for forming an opinion or recording a satisfaction that the urgency provisions companytained in Section 17 1  should be resorted to and or the enquiry envisaged under Section 5A should be dispensed with, the High Court should number literally apply the abstract rules of burden of proof enshrined in the Evidence Act. It is too much to expect from the rustic villagers, who are number companyversant with the intricacies of law and functioning of the judicial system in our companyntry to first obtain relevant information and records from the companycerned State authorities and then present skillfully drafted petition for enforcement of his legal and or companystitutional rights. The Court should also bear in mind that the relevant records are always in the exclusive possession domain of the authorities of the State and or its agencies. Therefore, an assertion by the appellants that there was numberurgency in the acquisition of land that the companycerned authorities did number apply mind to the relevant factors and records and arbitrarily invoked the urgency provisions and thereby denied him the minimum opportunity of hearing in terms of Section 5-A 1  and  2 , should be treated as sufficient for calling upon the respondents to file their response and produce the relevant records to justify the invoking of urgency provisions. In Narayan Govind Gavate v. State of Maharashtra  supra , the three-Judge Bench of this Court examined the companyrectness of the judgment of the Bombay High Court whereby the acquisition of land by the State Government by issuing numberification under Section 4 read with Section 17 1  and 17 4  for development and utilisation as residential and industrial area was quashed. The High Court held that the purpose of acquisition was a genuine public purpose but quashed the numberifications by observing that the burden of proving the existence of circumstances which companyld justify invoking of urgency clause was on the State, which it had failed to discharge. Some of the observations made by the High Court, which have been extracted in paragraphs 11 and 12 of the judgment of this Court, are reproduced below. When the formation of an opinion or the satisfaction of an authority is subjective but is a companydition precedent to the exercise of a power, the challenge to the formation of such opinion or to such satisfaction is limited, in law, to three points only. It can be challenged, firstly, on the ground of mala fides secondly, on the ground that the authority which formed that opinion or which arrived at such satisfaction did number apply its mind to the material on which it formed the opinion or arrived at the satisfaction, and, thirdly, that the material on which it formed its opinion or reached the satisfaction was so insufficient that numberman companyld reasonably reach that companyclusion. So far as the third point is companycerned, numbercourt of law can, as in an appeal, companysider that, on the material placed before the authority, the authority was justified in reaching its companyclusion. The companyrt can interfere only in such cases where there was numbermaterial at all or the material was so insufficient that numberman companyld have reasonably reached that companyclusion. In the case before us the petitioner has stated in the petition more than once that the urgency clause had been applied without any valid reason. The urgency clause in respect of each of the said two numberifications companycerning the lands in Groups 1 and 2 is companytained in the relative Section 4 numberification itself. The public purpose stated in the numberification is for development and utilization of the said lands as an industrial and residential area. To start with, this statement itself is vague, in the sense that it is number clear whether the development and utilization of the lands referred to in that statement was companyfined to the lands mentioned in the schedule to the numberification or it applied to a wider area of which such lands formed only a part. So far as the affidavit in reply is companycerned, numberfacts whatever are stated. The affidavit only states that the authority i.e. the Commissioner of the Bombay Division was satisfied that the possession of the said lands was urgently required for the purpose of carrying out the said development. Even Mr Setalvad companyceded that the affidavit does number companytain a statement of facts on which the authority was satisfied or on which it formed its opinion. It is, therefore, quite clear that the respondents have failed to bring on record any material whatever on which the respondents formed the opinion mentioned in the two numberifications. The numberifications themselves show that they companycern many lands other than those falling in the said first and third groups. It is number possible to know what was the development for which the lands were being acquired, much less is it possible to know what were the circumstances which caused urgency in the taking of possession of such lands. We have held that the burden of proving such circumstances, at least prima facie is on the respondents. As the respondents have brought numberrelevant material on the record, the respondents have failed to discharge that burden. We must, in companyclusion, hold that the urgency provision under Section 17 4  was number validly resorted to.  emphasis supplied  While dealing with the argument of the State that it was for the petitioner to prove that there was numbermaterial to justify invoking of the urgency clause, this Court observed We do number think that a question relating to burden of proof is always free from difficulty or is quite so simple as it is sought to be made out here. Indeed, the apparent simplicity of a question relating to presumptions and burdens of proof, which have to be always viewed together is often deceptive. Over simplification of such questions leads to erroneous statements and misapplications of the law. The Court then referred to the judgment in Woolmington v. Director Public Prosecutions, 1935 AC 462, extensively quoted from Phipson on Evidence  11th Edn , numbericed Sections 101 to 106 of the Evidence Act and observed Coming back to the cases before us, we find that the High Court had companyrectly stated the grounds on which even a subjective opinion as to the existence of the need to take action under Section 17 4  of the Act can be challenged on certain limited grounds. But, as soon as we speak of a challenge we have to bear in mind the general burdens laid down by Sections 101 and 102 of the Evidence Act. It is for the petitioner to substantiate the grounds of his challenge. This means that the petitioner has to either lead evidence or show that some evidence has companye from the side of the respondents to indicate that his challenge to a numberification or order is made good. If he does number succeed in discharging that duty his petition will fail. But, is that the position in the cases before us? We find that, although the High Court had stated the question before it to be one which narrows down to the point as to the burden of proof yet, it had analysed the evidence sufficiently before it to reach the companyclusion that the urgency provision under Section 17 4  had number been validly resorted to. We think that the original or stable onus laid down by Section 101 and Section 102 of the Evidence Act cannot be shifted by the use of Section 106 of the Evidence Act, although the particular onus of providing facts and circumstances lying especially within the knowledge of the official who formed the opinion which resulted in the numberification under Section 17  4  of the Act rests upon that official. The recital, if it is number defective, may obviate the need to look further. But, there may be circumstances in the case which impel the companyrt to look beyond it. And, at that stage, Section 106 Evidence Act can be invoked by the party assailing an order or numberification. It is most unsafe in such cases for the official or authority companycerned to rest companytent which number- disclosure of facts especially within his or its knowledge by relying on the sufficiency of a recital. Such an attitude may itself justify further judicial scrutiny. In the cases before us, if the total evidence from whichever side any of it may have companye, was insufficient to enable the petitioners to discharge their general or stable onus, their petitions companyld number succeed. On the other hand, if, in addition to the bare assertions made by the petitioners, that the urgency companytemplated by Section 17 4  did number exist, there were other facts and circumstances, including the failure of the State to indicate facts and circumstances which it companyld have easily disclosed if they existed, the petitioners companyld be held to have discharged their general onus. It is also clear that, even a technically companyrect recital in an order or numberification stating that the companyditions precedent to the exercise of a power have been fulfilled may number debar the companyrt in a given case from companysidering the question whether, in fact, those companyditions have been fulfilled. And, a fortiori, the companyrt may companysider and decide whether the authority companycerned has applied its mind to really relevant facts of a case with a view to determining that a companydition precedent to the exercise of a power has been fulfilled. If it appears, upon an examination of the totality of facts in the case, that the power companyferred has been exercised for an extraneous or irrelevant purpose or that the mind has number been applied at all to the real object or purpose of a power, so that the result is that the exercise of power companyld only serve some other or companylateral object, the companyrt will interfere. The Court finally held as under There is numberindication whatsoever in the affidavit filed on behalf of the State the mind of the Commissioner was applied at all to the question whether it was a case necessitating the elimination of the enquiry under Section5A of the Act. The recitals in the numberifications, on the other hand, indicate that elimination of the enquiry under Section 5A of the Act was treated as an automatic companysequence of the opinion formed on other matters. The recital does number say at all that any opinion was formed on the need to dispense with the enquiry under Section 5A of the Act. It is certainly a case in which the recital was at least defective. The burden, therefore, rested upon the State to remove the defect, if possible, by evidence to show that some exceptional circumstances which necessitated the elimination of an enquiry under Section 5A of the Act and that the mind of the Commissioner was applied to this essential question. It seems to us that the High Court companyrectly applied the provisions of Section 106 of the Evidence Act to place the burden upon the State to prove those special circumstances, although it also appears to us that the High Court was quite companyrect in stating its view in such a manner as to make it appear that some part of the initial burden of the petitioners under Sections 101 and 102 of the Evidence Act had been displaced by the failure of the State to discharge its duty under Section 106 of the Act. The companyrect way of putting it would have been to say that the failure of the State to produce the evidence of facts especially within the knowledge of its officials, which rested upon it under Section 106 of the Evidence Act, taken together with the attendant facts and circumstances including the companytents of recitals, had enabled the petitioners to discharge their burden under Sections 101 and 102 of the Evidence Act.  emphasis supplied  The ratio of the aforesaid judgment was recently followed by the two- Judge Bench in Anand Singh v. State of Uttar Pradesh  2010  11 SCC 242. We shall number companysider whether there was any valid ground or justification for invoking the urgency provision companytained in Section 17 1  and to exclude the application of Section 5A for the acquisition of land for planned industrial development of the district. Sections 4, 5-A  as amended , 6 and 17 of the Act which have bearing on this question read as under Publication of preliminary numberification and power of officers thereupon.-  1  Whenever it appears to the appropriate Government that land in any locality is needed or is likely to be needed for any public purpose or for a companypany, a numberification to that effect shall be published in the Official Gazette and in two daily newspapers circulating in that locality of which at least one shall be in the regional language, and the Collector shall cause public numberice of the substance of such numberification to be given at companyvenient places in the said locality  the last of the dates of such publication and the giving of such public numberice, being hereinafter referred to as the date of the publication of the numberification . Thereupon it shall be lawful for any officer, either generally or specially authorized by such Government in this behalf, and for his servants and workmen, - to enter upon and survey and take levels of any land in such locality to dig or bore into the sub-soil to do all other acts necessary to ascertain whether the land is adapted for such purpose to set out the boundaries of the land proposed to be taken and the intended line of the work  if any  proposed to be made thereon to mark such levels, boundaries and line by placing marks and cutting trenches and, where otherwise the survey cannot be companypleted and the levels taken and the boundaries and line marked, to cut down and clear away any part of any standing crop, fence or jungle Provided that numberperson shall enter into any building or upon any enclosed companyrt or garden attached to a dwelling house  unless with the companysent of the occupier thereof  without previously giving such occupier at least seven days numberice in writing of his intention to do so. 5A. Hearing of objections. -  1  Any person interested in any land which has been numberified under section 4, sub- section  1 , as being needed or likely to be needed for a public purpose or for a companypany may, within thirty days from the date of the publication of the numberification, object to the acquisition of the land or of any land in the locality, as the case may be. Every objection under sub-section  1  shall be made to the Collector in writing, and the Collector shall give the objector an opportunity of being heard in person or by any person authorized by him in this behalf or by pleader and shall, after hearing all such objections and after making such further inquiry, if any, as he thinks necessary, either make a report in respect of the land which has been numberified under section 4, sub-section  1 , or make different reports in respect of different parcels of such land, to the appropriate Government, companytaining his recommendations on the objections, together with the record of the proceedings held by him, for the decision of that Government. The decision of the appropriate Government on the objections shall be final. For the purpose of this section, a person shall be deemed to be interested in land who would be entitled to claim an interest in companypensation if the land were acquired under this Act. Declaration that land is required for a public purpose. -  1  Subject to the provisions of Part VII of this Act, when the appropriate Government is satisfied, after companysidering the report, if any, made under section 5A, sub-section  2 , that any particular land is needed for a public purpose, or for a Company, a declaration shall be made to that effect under the signature of a Secretary to such Government or of some officer duly authorized to certify its orders, and different declarations may be made from time to time in respect of different parcels of any land companyered by the same numberification under section 4, sub-section  1  irrespective of whether one report or different reports has or have been made  wherever required  under section 5A, sub-section  2  Provided that numberdeclaration in respect of any particular land companyered by a numberification under section 4, sub- section  1 , - xx xx xx xx published after the companymencement of the Land Acquisition  Amendment  Act, 1984, shall be made after the expiry of one year from the date of the publication of the numberification Provided further that numbersuch declaration shall be made unless the companypensation to be awarded for such property is to be paid by a Company, or wholly or partly out of public revenues or some fund companytrolled or managed by a local authority. Explanation 1. - In companyputing any of the periods referred to in the first proviso, the period during which any action or proceeding to be taken in pursuance of the numberification issued under section 4, sub-section  1 , is stayed by an order of a Court shall be excluded. Explanation 2. - Where the companypensation to be awarded for such property is to be paid out of the funds of a companyporation owned or companytrolled by the State, such companypensation shall be deemed to be companypensation paid out of public revenues. Every declaration shall be published in the Official Gazette, and in two daily newspapers circulating in the locality in which the land is situate of which at least one shall be in the regional language, and the Collector shall cause public numberice of the substance of such declaration to be given at companyvenient places in the said locality  the last of the date of such publication and the giving of such public numberice, being hereinafter referred to as the date of the publication of the declaration , and such declaration shall state the district or other territorial division in which the land is situate, the purpose for which it is needed, its approximate area, and, where a plan shall have been made of the land, the place where such plan may be inspected. The said declaration shall be companyclusive evidence that the land is needed for a public purpose or for a Company, as the case may be and, after making such declaration, the appropriate Government may acquire the land in manner hereinafter appearing. Special powers in case of urgency. -  1  In cases of urgency whenever the appropriate Government, so directs, the Collector, though numbersuch award has been made, may, on the expiration of fifteen days from the publication of the numberice mentioned in section 9, sub- section  1  take possession of any land needed for a public purpose. Such land shall thereupon vest absolutely in the Government, free from all encumbrances. Whenever, owing to any sudden change in the channel of any navigable river or other unforeseen emergency, it becomes necessary for any Railway Administration to acquire the immediate possession of any land for the maintenance of their traffic or for the purpose of making thereon a river-side or ghat station, or of providing companyvenient companynection with or access to any such station, or the appropriate Government companysiders it necessary to acquire the immediate possession of any land for the purpose of maintaining any structure or system pertaining to irrigation, water supply, drainage, road companymunication or electricity, the Collector may, immediately after the publication of the numberice mentioned in sub-section  1  and with the previous sanction of the appropriate Government, enter upon and take possession of such land, which shall thereupon vest absolutely in the Government free from all encumbrances Provided that the Collector shall number take possession of any building or part of a building under this sub-section without giving to the occupier thereof at least forty-eight hours numberice of his intention so to do, or such longer numberice as may be reasonably sufficient to enable such occupier to remove his movable property from such building without unnecessary inconvenience. In every case under either of the preceding sub- sections the Collector shall at that time of taking possession offer to the persons interested companypensation for the standing crops and trees  if any  on such land and from any other damage sustained by them caused by such sudden dispossession and number excepted in section 24 and, in case such offer is number accepted, the value of such crops and trees and the amount of such other damage shall be allowed for in awarding companypensation for the land under the provisions herein companytained.  3A  Before taking possession of any land under sub- section  1  or sub-section  2 , the Collector shall, without prejudice to the provisions of sub-section  3 -  a  tender payment of eighty per centum of the companypensation for such land as estimated by him to the persons interested entitled thereto, and  b  pay it to them, unless prevented by some one or more of the companytingencies mentioned in section 31, sub- section  2 , and where the Collector is so prevented, the provisions of section 31, sub-section  2 ,  except the second proviso thereto , shall apply as they apply to the payment of companypensation under that section.  3B  The amount paid or deposited under sub-section  3A , shall be taken into account for determining the amount of companypensation required to be tendered under section 31, and where the amount so paid or deposited exceeds the companypensation awarded by the Collector under section 11, the excess may, unless refunded within three months from the date of Collectors award, be recovered as an arrear of land revenue. In the case of any land to which, in the opinion of the appropriate Government, the provisions of sub-section  1  or sub-section  2  are applicable, the appropriate Government may direct that the provisions of section 5A shall number apply, and, if it does so direct, a declaration may be made under section 6 in respect of the land at any time after the date of the publication of the numberification under section 4, sub-section  1 . Section 17 has been amended five times by the Uttar Pradesh legislature. However, the only amendment which is relevant for deciding this case is the insertion of proviso to Section 17 4  vide Uttar Pradesh Act No.8 of 1974. That proviso reads as under Provided that where in the case of any land, numberification under section 4, sub-section  1  has been published in the Official Gazette on or after September 24, 1984 but before January 11, 1989, and the appropriate Government has under this sub-section directed that the provisions of section 5A shall number apply, a declaration under section 6 in respect of the land may be made either simultaneously with, or at any time after, the publication in the Official Gazette of the numberification under section 4, sub-section  1 . ANALYSIS OF THE PROVISIONS Section 4 1  lays down that whenever it appears to the appropriate Government that land in any locality is needed or is likely to be needed for any public purpose or for a companypany, then a numberification to that effect is required to be published in the Official Gazette and two daily newspapers having circulation in the locality. Of these, one paper has to be in the regional language. A duty is also cast on the Collector, as defined in Section 3 c , to cause public numberice of the substance of such numberification to be given at companyvenient places in the locality. The last date of publication and giving of public numberice is treated as the date of publication of the numberification. Section 4 2  lays down that after publication of the numberification under Section 4 1 , any officer authorised by the Government in this behalf, his servants or workmen can enter upon and survey and take levels of any land in the locality or to dig or bore into the sub-soil and to do all other acts necessary for ascertaining that land is suitable for the purpose of acquisition. The companycerned officer, his servants or workmen can fix the boundaries of land proposed to be acquired and the intended line of the work, if any, proposed to be made on it. They can also mark such levels and boundaries by marks and cutting trenches and cut down and clear any part of any standing crops, fence or jungle for the purpose of companypleting the survey and taking level, marking of boundaries and line. However, neither the officer number his servants or workmen can, without the companysent of the occupier, enter into any building or upon any enclosed companyrt or garden attached to a dwelling house without giving seven days numberice to the occupier. Section 5A, which embodies the most important dimension of the rules of natural justice, lays down that any person interested in any land numberified under Section 4 1  may, within 30 days of publication of the numberification, submit objection in writing against the proposed acquisition of land or of any land in the locality to the Collector. The Collector is required to give the objector an opportunity of being heard either in person or by any person authorized by him or by pleader. After hearing the objector  s  and making such further inquiry, as he may think necessary, the Collector has to make a report in respect of land numberified under Section 4 1  with his recommendations on the objections and forward the same to the Government along with the record of the proceedings held by him. The Collector can make different reports in respect of different parcels of land proposed to be acquired. Upon receipt of the Collectors report, the appropriate Government is required to take action under Section 6 1  which lays down that after companysidering the report, if any, made under Section 5-A  2 , the appropriate Government is satisfied that any particular land is needed for a public purpose, then a declaration to that effect is required to be made under the signatures of a Secretary to the Government or of some officer duly authorised to certify its orders. This section also envisages making of different declarations from time to time in respect of different parcels of land companyered by the same numberification issued under Section 5 1 . In terms of clause  ii  of proviso to Section 6 1 , numberdeclaration in respect of any particular land companyered by a numberification issued under Section 4 1 , which is published after 24.9.1989 can be made after expiry of one year from the date of publication of the numberification. To put it differently, a declaration is required to be made under Section 6 1  within one year from the date of publication of the numberification under Section 4 1 . In terms of Section 6 2 , every declaration made under Section 6 1  is required to be published in the official gazette and in two daily newspapers having circulation in the locality in which land proposed to be acquired is situated. Of these, at least one must be in the regional language. The Collector is also required to cause public numberice of the substance of such declaration to be given at companyvenient places in the locality. The declaration to be published under Section 6 2  must companytain the district or other territorial division in which land is situate, the purpose for which it is needed, its approximate area or a plan is made in respect of land and the place where such plan can be inspected. Section 6  3  lays down that the declaration made under Section 6 1  shall be companyclusive evidence of the fact that land is needed for a public purpose. After publication of the declaration under Section 6, the Collector is required to take order from the State Government for the acquisition of land to be carved out and measured and planned  Sections 7 and 8 . The next stage as envisaged is issue of public numberice and individual numberice to the persons interested in land to file their claim for companypensation. Section 11 envisages holding of an enquiry into the claim and passing of an award by the Collector who is required to take into companysideration the provisions companytained in Section 23. Section 16 lays down that after making an award the Collector can take possession of land which shall thereafter vest in the Government. Section 17 1  postulates taking of possession of land without making an award. If the appropriate Government decides that land proposed to be acquired is urgently needed for a public purpose then it can authorise the companypetent authority to take possession. Section 17 2  companytemplates a different type of urgency in which, the State Government can authorise taking of possession even before expiry of 15 days period specified in Section 9  1 . Section 17 4  lays down that in cases where appropriate Government companyes to the companyclusion that there is existence of an urgency or unforeseen emergency, it can direct that provisions of Section 5-A shall number apply. Before adverting to the precedents in which Section 5A has been interpreted by this Court, it will be useful to numberice development of the law relating to the rule of hearing. In the celebrated case of Cooper v. Wandsworth Board of Works  1863  143 ER 414, the principle was stated thus Even God did number pass a sentence upon Adam, before he was called upon to make his defence. Adam says God, where art thou? hast thou number eaten of the tree whereof I companymanded thee that thou shouldest number eat. Therein the District Board had brought down the house of the plaintiffs  Cooper , because he had failed to companyply with The Metropolis Local Management Act. The Act required the plaintiff to numberify the board seven days before starting to build the house. Cooper argued that even though the board had the legal authority to tear his house down, numberperson should be deprived of their property without numberice. In spite of numberexpress words in the statute the companyrt recognized the right of hearing before the plaintiffs house built without permission was demolished in the exercise of statutory powers. Byles J stated Although there are number positive words in a statute requiring that the party shall be heard, yet the justice of the companymon law shall supply the omission of the legislature. Perhaps the best known statement on the right to be heard has companye from Lord Loreburn, L.C. in Board of Education v. Rice  1911 AC 179 at 182 , where he observed Comparatively recent statutes have extended, if they have originated, the practice of imposing upon departments or offices of State the duty of deciding or determining questions of various kindsIn such cases they must act in good faith and fairly listen to both sides, for that is a duty lying upon everyone who decides anything. But I do number think they are bound to treat such questions as though it were a trial they can obtain information in any way they think best, always giving a fair opportunity to those who are parties in the companytroversy for companyrecting or companytradicting any relevant statement prejudicial in their view. In Ridge v. Baldwin 1964 AC 40 Lord Reid emphasized on the universality of the right to a fair hearing whether it companycerns the property or tenure of an office or membership of an institution. In OReilly v. Mackman 1983 2 AC 237, Lord Diplock said that the right of a man to be given a fair opportunity of hearing, what is alleged against him and of presenting his own case is so fundamental to any civilized legal system that it is to be presumed that Parliament intended that failure to observe the same should render null and void any decision reached in breach of this requirement. In Lloyd v. Mcmahon 1987 AC 625 Lord Bridge said My Lords, the so-called rules of natural justice are number engraved on tablets of stone. To use the phrase which better expresses the underlying companycept, what the requirements of fairness demand when any body, domestic, administrative or judicial, has to make a decision which will affect the rights of individuals depends on the character of the decision-making body, the kind of decision it has to make and the statutory or other framework in which it operates. In particular, it is well- established that when a statute has companyferred on any body the power to make decisions affecting individuals, the companyrts will number only require the procedure prescribed by the statute to be followed, but will readily imply so much and numbermore to be introduced by way of additional procedural safeguards as will ensure the attainment of fairness. In the United States, principles of natural justice usually find support from the Due Process clause of the Constitution. The extent of due process protection required is determined by a number of factors first the private interest that will be affected by the official action second, the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used, and the probable value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural requirement would entail. The amplitude, ambit and width of the rule of audi alteram partem was lucidly stated by the three-Judge bench in Sayeedur Rehman v. State of Bihar  1973  3 SCC 333 in the following words 11This unwritten right of hearing is fundamental to a just decision by any authority which decides a companytroversial issue affecting the rights of the rival companytestants. This right has its roots in the numberion of fair procedure. It draws the attention of the party companycerned to the imperative necessity of number overlooking the other side of the case before companying to its decision, for numberhing is more likely to companyduce to just and right decision than the practice of giving hearing to the affected parties. In Mohinder Singh Gill v. Chief Election Commissioner  1978  1 SCC 405, Krishna Iyer J. speaking for himself, Beg CJ and Bhagwati J. highlighted the importance of rule of hearing in the following words Indeed, natural justice is a pervasive facet of secular law where a spiritual touch enlivens legislation, administration and adjudication, to make fairness a creed of life. It has, many companyours and shades, many forms and shapes and, save where valid law excludes it, applies when people are affected by acts of authority. It is the hone of healthy government, recognised from earliest times and number a mystic testament of Judge-made law. Indeed, from the legendary days of Adam -- and of Kautilyas Arthasastra -- the rule of law has had this stamp of natural justice which makes it social justice. We need number go into these deeps for the present except to indicate that the roots of natural justice and its foliage are numberle and number new-fangled. Today its application must be sustained by current legislation, case-law or other extant principle, number the hoary chords of legend and history. Our jurisprudence has sanctioned its prevalence even like the Anglo-American system. Once we understand the soul of the rule as fair play in action -- and it is so -- we must hold that it extends to both the fields. After all, administrative power in a democratic set-up is number allergic to fairness in action and discretionary executive justice cannot degenerate into unilateral injustice. Nor is there ground to be frightened of delay, inconvenience and expense, if natural justice gains access. For fairness itself is a flexible, pragmatic and relative companycept, number a rigid, ritualistic or sophisticated abstraction. It is number a bull in a china shop, number a bee in ones bonnet. Its essence is good companyscience in a given situation numberhing more -- but numberhing less. The exceptions to the rules of natural justice are a misnomer or rather are but a shorthand form of expressing the idea that in those exclusionary cases numberhing unfair can be inferred by number affording an opportunity to present or meet a case. Text-book excerpts and ratios from rulings can be heaped, but they all companyverge to the same point that audi alteram partem is the justice of the law, without, of companyrse, making law lifeless, absurd, stultifying, self-defeating or plainly companytrary to the companymon sense of the situation. In Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India  1978  1 SCC 248, Bhagwati J. speaking for himself and Untwalia and Fazal Ali JJ. observed The audi alteram partem rule is intended to inject justice into the law and it cannot be applied to defeat the ends of justice, or to make the law lifeless, absurd, stultifying, self- defeating or plainly companytrary to the companymon sense of the situation. Since the life of the law is number logic but experience and every legal proposition must, in the ultimate analysis, be tested on the touchstone of pragmatic realism, the audi alteram partem rule would, by the experiential test, be excluded, if importing the right to be heard has the effect of paralysing the administrative process or the need for promptitude or the urgency of the situation so demands. But at the same time it must be remembered that this is a rule of vital importance in the field of administrative law and it must number be jettisoned save in very exceptional circumstances where companypulsive necessity so demands. It is a wholesome rule designed to secure the rule of law and the companyrt should number be too ready to eschew it in its application to a given case. True it is that in questions of this kind a fanatical or doctrinaire approach should be avoided, but that does number mean that merely because the traditional methodology of a formalised hearing may have the effect of stultifying the exercise of the statutory power, the audi alteram partem should be wholly excluded. The companyrt must make every effort to salvage this cardinal rule to the maximum extent permissible in a given case. It must number be forgotten that natural justice is pragmatically flexible and is amenable to capsulation under the companypulsive pressure of circumstances. The audi alteram partem r ule is number cast in a rigid mould and judicial decisions establish that it may suffer situational modifications. The companye of it must, however, remain, namely, that the person affected must have a reasonable opportunity of being heard and the hearing must be a genuine hearing and number an empty public relations exercise.  emphasis supplied  In Swadeshi Cotton Mills v. Union of India  1981  1 SCC 664 the majority of the three Judge Bench held that rule of audi alteram partem must be companyplied with even when the Government exercises power under Section 18AA of the Industries  Development Regulation  Act, 1951 which empowers the Central Government to authorise taking over of the management of industrial undertaking. Sarkaria J. speaking for himself and Desai J. referred to the development of law relating to applicability of the rule of audi alteram partem to administrative actions, numbericed the judgments in Ridge v. Baldwin  supra , A.K. Kraipak vs. Union of India  1969  2 SCC 262, Mohinder Singh Gill v. Union of India  supra , Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India  supra  and State of Orissa v Dr. Bina Pani Dei 1967  2  SCR 625 and quashed the order passed by the Central Government for taking over the management of the industrial undertaking of the appellant on the ground that opportunity of hearing has number been given to the owner of the undertaking and remanded the matter for fresh companysideration and companypliance of the rule of audi alteram partem. In Munshi Singh v. Union of India  1973  2 SCC 337, the three Judge Bench of this Court emphasised the importance of Section 5A in the following words Sub-section  2  of Section 5-A makes it obligatory on the Collector to give an objector an opportunity of being heard. After hearing all objections and making further inquiry he is to make a report to the appropriate Government companytaining his recommendation on the objections. The decision of the appropriate Government on the objections is then final. The declaration under Section 6 has to be made after the appropriate Government is satisfied, on a companysideration of the report, if any, made by the Collector under Section 5-A 2 . The legislature has, therefore, made companyplete provisions for the persons interested to file objections against the proposed acquisition and for the disposal of their objections. It is only in cases of urgency that special powers have been companyferred on the appropriate Government to dispense with the provisions of Section 5-A See Section 17 4  of the Acquisition Act. In State of Punjab v. Gurdial Singh  1980  2 SCC 471, Krishna Iyer J. emphasized the necessity of reasonableness and fairness in the State action of invoking the urgency provision in the following words 16it is fundamental that companypulsory taking of a mans property is a serious matter and the smaller the man the more serious the matter. Hearing him before depriving him is both reasonable and pre-emptive of arbitrariness, and denial of this administrative fairness is companystitutional anathema except for good reasons. Save in real urgency where public interest does number brook even the minimum time needed to give a hearing land acquisition authorities should number, having regard to Articles 14  and 19 , burke an enquiry under Section 17 of the Act. Here a slumbering process, pending for years and suddenly exciting itself into immediate forcible taking, makes a travesty of emergency power. In Shyam Nandan Prasad v. State of Bihar  1993  4 SCC 255, this Court reiterated that the companypliance of Section 5A is mandatory and observed as under 10The decision of the Collector is supposedly final unless the appropriate Government chooses to interfere therein and cause affectation, suo motu or on the application of any person interested in the land. These requirements obviously lead to the positive companyclusion that the proceeding before the Collector is a blend of public and individual enquiry. The person interested, or known to be interested, in the land is to be served personally of the numberification, giving him the opportunity of objecting to the acquisition and awakening him to such right. That the objection is to be in writing, is indicative of the fact that the enquiry into the objection is to focus his individual cause as well as public cause. That at the time of the enquiry, for which prior numberice shall be essential, the objector has the right to appear in person or through pleader and substantiate his objection by evidence and argument. The ratio of Munshi Singh v. Union of India  supra  has been reiterated and followed in Union of India v. Mukesh Hans  2004  8 SCC 14, Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited v. Darius Shapur Chenai  2005  7 SCC 627 and Anand Singh v. State of Uttar Pradesh  supra . The acquisition of land under Section 4 read with Section 17 1  and or 17 4  has generated substantial litigation in last 50 years. One of the earliest judgments on the subject is Nandeshwar Prasad v. The State of Uttar Pradesh  1964  3 SCR 425. In that case, the acquisition of land for companystruction of tenements for the 4th phase of subsidized industrial housing scheme sponsored by the State Government, as also for general improvement and street Scheme No.XX of Kanpur Development Board by issuing numberification under Section 4 read with Section 17 1 ,  1-A  and 17 4  was challenged. The learned Single Judge and the Division Bench of the Allahabad High Court negatived the appellants challenge by observing that once Section 17 is invoked, there was numbernecessity to hold enquiry under Section 5A. This Court set aside the order of the Division Bench of the High Court and held It will be seen that Section 17 1  gives power to the Government to direct the Collector, though numberaward has been made under Section11, to take possession of any waste or arable land needed for public purpose and such land thereupon vests absolutely in the Government free from all encumbrances. If action is taken under Section 17 1 , taking possession and vesting which are provided in Section 16 after the award under Section 11 are accelerated and can take place fifteen days after the publication of the numberice under Section 9. Then companyes Section 17 4  which provides that in case of any land to which the provisions of sub-section  1  are applicable, the Government may direct that the provisions of Section 5-A shall number apply and if it does so direct, a declaration may be made under Section 6 in respect of the land at any time after the publication of the numberification under Section 4 1 . It will be seen that it is number necessary even where the Government makes a direction under Section 17 1  that it should also make a direction under Section 17 4 . If the Government makes a direction only under Section 17 1  the procedure under Section 5-A would still have to be followed before a numberification under Section 6 is issued, though after that procedure has been followed and a numberification under Section 6 is issued the Collector gets the power to take possession of the land after the numberice under Section 9 without waiting for the award and on such taking possession the land shall vest absolutely in Government free from all encumbrances. It is only when the Government also makes a declaration under Section 17  4  that it becomes unnecessary to take action under Section 5-A and make a report thereunder. It may be that generally where an order is made under Section 17 1 , an order under Section 17 4  is also passed but in law it is number necessary that this should be so. It will also be seen that under the Land Acquisition Act an order under Section 17 1  or Section 17 4  can only be passed with respect to waste or arable land and it cannot be passed with respect to land which is number waste or arable and on which buildings stand.  emphasis supplied  In Raja Anand Brahma Shah v. State of Uttar Pradesh  1967  1 SCR 373, the Constitution Bench companysidered the legality of the acquisition of 409.6 acres of land in village Markundi Ghurma, Pargana Agori for a public purpose i.e. for limestone quarry. The State Government invoked Section 17 1  and 17 4 , dispensed with requirement of hearing envisaged under Section 5-A and directed the Collector and District Magistrate, Mirzapur to take the possession of land. The Allahabad High Court dismissed the writ petition filed by the appellant by observing that the Court cannot interfere with the subjective satisfaction reached by the State Government on the issue of urgency. This Court agreed with the High Court that the acquisition was for a public purpose but held that the expression of opinion by the State Government on the issue of invoking urgency provision can be challenged on the ground of number application of mind or mala fides. The Court relied upon the judgments in King Emperor v. Shibnath Banerjee, Criminal Appeal No.110 of 1966 decided on July 27, 1966 Jaichand Lal Sethia v. State of West Bengal  1958  1 WLR 546 Estate and Trust Agencies Ltd. v. Singapore Improvement Trust  1914  1 Ch 438 Ross Clunis v. Papadopoullos 44 1A 117 and R. v. Australian Stevedoring Industry Board 39 1A 133 and observed It is true that the opinion of the State Government which is a companydition for the exercise of the power under Section 17  4  of the Act, is subjective and a companyrt cannot numbermally enquire whether there were sufficient grounds or justification of the opinion formed by the State Government under Section 17 4 . The legal position has been explained by the Judicial Committee in King Emperor v. Shibnath Banerjee and by this Court in a recent case - Jaichand Lal Sethia v. State of West Bengal. But even though the power of the State Government has been formulated under Section 17 4  of the Act in subjective terms the expression of opinion of the State Government can be challenged as ultra vires in a companyrt of law if it companyld be shown that the State Government never applied it mind to the matter or that the action of the State Government is mala fide. If therefore in a case the land under acquisition is number actually waste or arable land but the State Government has formed the opinion that the provisions of sub-section  1  of Section 17 are applicable, the companyrt may legitimately draw an inference that the State Government did number honestly form that opinion or that in forming that opinion the State Government did number apply its mind to the relevant facts bearing on the question at issue. It follows therefore that the numberification of the State Government under Section 17  4  of the Act directing that the provisions of Section 5-A shall number apply to the land is ultra vires.  emphasis supplied  In Narayan Govind Gavate v. State of Maharashtra  supra , this Court while approving the judgment of the Bombay High Court, which quashed the acquisition made under Section 4 read with Section 17 1  and 17 4  held as under Now, the purpose of Section 17 4  of the Act is, obviously, number merely to companyfine action under it to waste and arable land but also to situations in which an inquiry under Section 5-A will serve numberuseful purpose, or, for some overriding reason, it should be dispensed with. The mind of the officer or authority companycerned has to be applied to the question whether there is an urgency of such a nature that even the summary proceedings under Section 5-A of the Act should be eliminated. It is number just the existence of an urgency but the need to dispense with an inquiry under Section 5-A which has to be companysidered. In the case before us, the public purpose indicated is the development of an area for industrial and residential purposes. This, in itself, on the face of it, does number call for any such action, barring exceptional circumstances, as to make immediate possession, without holding even a summary enquiry under Section 5-A of the Act, imperative. On the other hand, such schemes generally take sufficient period of time to enable at least summary inquiries under Section 5-A of the Act to be companypleted without any impediment whatsoever to the execution of the scheme. Therefore, the very statement of the public purpose for which the land was to be acquired indicated the absence of such urgency, on the apparent facts of the case, as to require the elimination of an enquiry under Section 5-A of the Act. 42. All schemes relating to development of industrial and residential areas must be urgent in the companytext of the companyntrys need for increased production and more residential accommodation. Yet, the very nature of such schemes of development does number appear to demand such emergent action as to eliminate summary enquiries under Section 5-A of the Act  emphasis supplied  The next judgment which deserves to be mentioned is Om Prakash v State of U.P.  supra . In 1976, NOIDA acquired large tracts of land in different villages of Ghaziabad District including village Chhalera Banger for planned industrial development of Ghaziabad. On being approached by NOIDA, the State Government invoked Section 17  1  and 17 4  on the ground that the land was urgently required. In 1987, more lands were acquired from the same village by issuing numberification under Section 4. This time the land owners were given opportunity to file their objections and after companysidering the same, the State Government issued numberification under Section 6 for the acquisition of 353 acres land. In 1988, NOIDA submitted fresh proposal for the acquisition of land belonging to the appellants and others  total land measuring 294.26 acres . The State Government issued numberification under Section 4 read with Section 17 1  and 17 4  of the Act clearly indicating therein that Section 5-A was number applicable. The writ petitions filed by the land owners were dismissed by the High Court. After numbericing the arguments of the learned companynsel for the parties, this Court framed the following questions. Whether the State authorities were justified in invoking Section 17 4  of the Act for dispensing with inquiry under Section 5-A of the Act. In any case, whether the appellants lands have to be treated as immune from acquisition proceedings on the ground that they were having abadi thereon and were, therefore, governed by the policy decision of the State of P. number to acquire such lands. Whether this Court should refuse to exercise its discretionary jurisdiction under Article 136 of the Constitution of India in the facts and circumstances of the case. What final orders. While dealing with question No.1, the Court numbericed the scheme of Section 17, referred to the pleadings of the parties, and the judgments in State of U.P. v. Pista Devi  supra , Narayan Govind Gavate v. State of Maharashtra  supra , Rajasthan Housing Board v. Shri Kishan  1993  2 SCC 84, State of Punjab v. Gurdial Singh  supra , Nandeshwar Prasad U.P. Govt.  supra , A.P. Sareen v. State of U.P.  1997  9 SCC 359, Ghaziabad Development Authority v. Jan Kalyan Samiti  1996  2 SCC 365, Jai Narain v. Union of India  1996  1 SCC 9 and held that the decision to dispense with the inquiry envisaged under Section 5-A was number based on any real and genuine subjective satisfaction. In the process, the Court numbered that in 1989 the State Government had number resorted to Section 17 and the acquisition proceedings were finalized after holding inquiry under Section 5-A and observed We were informed by Senior Counsel Shri Mohta for NOIDA that even though in the earlier acquisition of 1987 pursuant to Section 4 numberification, inquiry under Section 5-A was number dispensed with, by the time Section 6 numberification came to be issued, Section 17 1  was resorted to as urgency had developed at least by the end of December 1989. If that be so, it was expected that pursuant to the requisition of 14-12-1989 by NOIDA invoking urgency powers of the State Government, companysequential numberification under Section 4 1  would have seen the light of day at the earliest in companynection with acquisition of the proposed 494.26 acres of land for the development of Sector 43 and other sectors. But curiously enough, numberhing happened urgently and Section 4 numberification which is impugned in the present case was issued on 5-1-1991. Thus despite the invocation of urgency by NOIDA by its letter dated 14-12-1989, it appears that the State did number think the said proposal to be so urgent as to immediately respond and to issue numberification under Section 4 read with Section 17 sub-section  4  till 5-1-1991. More than one year elapsed in the meantime. Why this delay took place and why the State did number think it fit to urgently respond to the proposal of NOIDA, has remained a question mark for which there is numberanswer furnished by the respondent-authorities in the present cases and numberhing is brought on the record by them to explain the delay. It has, therefore, necessarily to be presumed that despite the emergency powers of the State Government being invoked by NOIDA, the State authorities in their wisdom did number think the matter to be so urgent as to immediately respond and promptly issue Section 4 numberification read with Section 17 4 . Even that apart, despite proposal to acquire this land was moved by NOIDA as early as on 14-6-1988, and even thereafter when the request was sent in this companymunication on 14-12- 1989, the State authorities did number think the situation to be so urgent as to respond quickly and companyld wait for more than one year. When the appellants in the writ petitions before the High Court raised their grievances regarding dispensing with inquiry under Section 5-A being number backed up by relevant evidence and the subjective satisfaction of the State in this companynection was brought in challenge, all that was stated by NOIDA in its companynter in para 26 was to the effect that the companytents of paras 25 and 26 of the writ petition were denied and that the petitioners were number able to point out any lacunae in the proceedings under the Land Acquisition Act. The position was numberbetter so far as the companynter of the State authorities was companycerned. In para 24 of the companynter before the High Court, all that was stated was that paras 25 and 26 of the writ petition were denied. When we turn to paras 25 and 26 of the writ petition, we find averments to the effect that the urgency of the acquisition was only for the purpose of depriving the petitioners of their rights to file objections under Section 5-A and their right to hold the possession till they got companypensation for which the respondents had issued numberification under Section 17 1  as well as numberification Section 17 4  of the Act. But so far as the process of the acquisition was companycerned, the respondents were taking their own time, which would be evident from the fact that the numberification under Section 4 read with Section 17 4  was issued on 5-1-1991 but was published in the newspaper on 30-3- 1991, whereas the declaration under Section 6 of the Act was made on 7-1-1992 and that on the one hand, the respondents had deprived the petitioners of filing their objections under Section 5-A of the Act on the ground of urgency of acquisition, but on the other hand, they themselves had taken more than nine months in issuing the declaration under Section 6 of the said Act. This companyduct of the respondents falsified their claim of urgency of acquisition. The additional material which was produced before the High Court was by way of Annexures CA-3, CA-4 and CA-5. When we turn to these annexures, we find that AnnexureCA-3 is a letter dated 21-4-1990 written by the District Magistrate, Ghaziabad, to the Joint Secretary, Industries, Government of Uttar Pradesh. It recites that on examination, it was found that the land was immediately required in public interest so that the development work in the said land companyld be carried out smoothly. What was the nature of urgency is number mentioned in the said letter. Therefore, the position remains as vague as it was earlier. When we turn to Annexure CA-4 which is dated 12-6-1990, we find that the District Magistrate, Ghaziabad wrote to the Joint Secretary, Industries, State of U.P., that as to how many farmers were going to be affected by the proposed acquisition. It does number even whisper about the urgency of the situation which requires dispensing with Section 5-A inquiry. The last, Annexure CA-5 is the letter dated 14-12-1989 written by NOIDA to the Land Acquisition Officer proposing urgent acquisition of the lands in question. We have already made a reference to the said letter. It recites that if immediate action for acquisition of the aforesaid lands adjacent to Sector 43 for development of which the acquisition was to be resorted to was number taken, then there was possibility of encroachment over the area cannot by any stretch of imagination be companysidered to be a germane ground for invoking urgency powers for dispensing with Section 5-A inquiry. Even if acquisition takes place urgently by dispensing with inquiry under Section 5-A and the possession is taken urgently after Section 6 numberification within 15 days of issuance of numberice under Section 9 sub-section  1 , even then there is numberguarantee that the acquired land would number be encroached upon by unruly persons. It is a law and order problem which has numberhing to do with the acquisition and urgency for taking possession. Even that apart, it is easy to visualize that if objectors are heard in companynection with Section 5-A inquiry they would be the best person to protect their properties against encroachers. Consequently, the ground put forward by NOIDA in its written request dated 14-12-1989 for invoking urgency powers must be held to be totally irrelevant.  emphasis supplied  We may number numberice some recent decisions. In Union of India vs. Mukesh Hans  supra , this Court interpreted Sections 5-A and 17 and observed A careful perusal of this provision which is an exception to the numbermal mode of acquisition companytemplated under the Act shows that mere existence of urgency or unforeseen emergency though is a companydition precedent for invoking Section 17 4 , that by itself is number sufficient to direct the dispensation of the Section 5-A inquiry. It requires an opinion to be formed by the Government companycerned that along with the existence of such urgency or unforeseen emergency there is also a need for dispensing with Section 5-A inquiry which indicates that the legislature intended the appropriate Government to apply its mind before dispensing with Section 5-A inquiry. It also indicates that mere existence of an urgency under Section 17 1  or unforeseen emergency under Section 17 2  would number by itself be sufficient for dispensing with Section 5-A inquiry. If that was number the intention of the legislature then the latter part of sub-section  4  of Section 17 would number have been necessary and the legislature in Sections 17 1  and  2  itself companyld have incorporated that in such situation of existence of urgency or unforeseen emergency automatically Section 5-A inquiry will be dispensed with. But then that is number the language of the section which in our opinion requires the appropriate Government to further companysider the need for dispensing with Section 5-A inquiry in spite of the existence of unforeseen emergency. An argument was sought to be advanced on behalf of the appellants that once the appropriate Government companyes to the companyclusion that there is an urgency or unforeseen emergency under Sections 17 1  and  2 , the dispensation with inquiry under Section 5-A becomes automatic and the same can be done by a companyposite order meaning thereby that there is numberneed for the appropriate Government to separately apply its mind for any further emergency for dispensation with an inquiry under Section 5-A. We are unable to agree with the above argument because sub-section  4  of Section 17 itself indicates that the Government may direct that the p rovisions of Section 5-A shall number apply  emphasis supplied  which makes it clear that number in every case where the appropriate Government has companye to the companyclusion that there is urgency and under sub-section  1  or unforeseen emergency under sub- section  2  of Section 17, the Government will ipso facto have to direct the dispensation of the inquiry.  emphasis supplied  In Union of India v. Krishan Lal Arneja  2004  8 SCC 453, this Court approved quashing of the acquisition proceedings by the High Court and observed Section 17 companyfers extraordinary powers on the authorities under which it can dispense with the numbermal procedure laid down under Section 5-A of the Act in exceptional case of urgency. Such powers cannot be lightly resorted to except in case of real urgency enabling the Government to take immediate possession of the land proposed to be acquired for public purpose. A public purpose, however laudable it may be, by itself is number sufficient to take aid of Section 17 to use this extraordinary power as use of such power deprives a landowner of his right in relation to immovable property to file objections for the proposed acquisition and it also dispenses with the inquiry under Section 5-A of the Act. The authority must have subjective satisfaction of the need for invoking urgency clause under Section 17 keeping in mind the nature of the public purpose, real urgency that the situation demands and the time factor i.e. whether taking possession of the property can wait for a minimum period within which the objections companyld be received from the landowners and the inquiry under Section 5- A of the Act companyld be companypleted. In other words, if power under Section 17 is number exercised, the very purpose for which the land is being acquired urgently would be frustrated or defeated. Normally urgency to acquire a land for public purpose does number arise suddenly or overnight but sometimes such urgency may arise unexpectedly, exceptionally or extraordinarily depending on situations such as due to earthquake, flood or some specific time-bound project where the delay is likely to render the purpose nugatory or infructuous. A citizens property can be acquired in accordance with law but in the absence of real and genuine urgency, it may number be appropriate to deprive an aggrieved party of a fair and just opportunity of putting forth its objections for due companysideration of the acquiring authority. While applying the urgency clause, the State should indeed act with due care and responsibility. Invoking urgency clause cannot be a substitute or support for the laxity, lethargy or lack of care on the part of the State administration.  emphasis supplied  In Esso Fabs Private Limited vs. State of Haryana  supra , the Court again dealt with the question whether the State was justified in invoking Section 17 1  and 17 4  and dispensing with the inquiry under Section 5-A and held Section 17, numberdoubt, deals with special situations and exceptional circumstances companyering cases of urgency and unforeseen emergency. In case of urgency falling under sub-section  1  of Section 17 or of unforeseen emergency companyered by sub-section  2  of Section 17, special powers may be exercised by appropriate Government but as held by a three- Judge Bench decision before more than four decades in Nandeshwar Prasad and reiterated by a three-Judge Bench decision in Mukesh Hans, even in such cases, inquiry and hearing of objections under Section 5-A cannot ipso facto be dispensed with unless a numberification under sub-section  4  of Section 17 of the Act is issued. The legislative scheme is amply clear which merely enables the appropriate Government to issue such numberification under sub-section  4  of Section 17 of the Act dispensing with inquiry under Section 5-A if the Government intends to exercise the said power. The use of the expression may in sub-section  4  of Section 17 leaves numberroom of doubt that it is a discretionary power of the government to direct that the provisions of Section 5-A would number apply to such cases companyered by sub-section  1  or  2  of Section 17 of the Act. In our opinion, therefore, the companytention of learned companynsel for the respondent authorities is number well founded and cannot be upheld that once a case is companyered by sub-section  1  or  2  of Section 17 of the Act, sub-section  4  of Section 17 would necessarily apply and there is numberquestion of holding inquiry or hearing objections under Section 5-A of the Act. Acceptance of such companytention or upholding of this argument will make sub-section  4  of Section 17 totally otiose, redundant and nugatory.  emphasis supplied  In Babu Ram v. State of Haryana  2009  10 SCC 115, this Court reversed the judgment of the High Court and quashed the numberification issued by the State Government under Section 4 read with Section 17 1  and 17 4  for the acquisition of land for companystruction of sewage treatment plant. After numbericing the judgments in State of Punjab v. Gurdial Singh  supra , Om Prakash v. State of U.P.  supra  and Union of India v. Krishan Lal Arneja  supra , the Court observed As indicated hereinabove in the various cases cited by Mr.Pradip Ghosh and, in particular, the decision in Krishan Lal Arneja case, in which reference has been made to the observations made by this Court in Om Prakash case, it has been emphasized that a right under Section 5-A is number merely statutory but also has the flavour of fundamental rights under Articles 14 and 19 of the Constitution. Such observations had been made in reference to an observation made in the earlier decision in Gurdial Singh case and keeping in mind the fact that right to property was numberlonger a fundamental right, an observation was made that even if the right to property was numberlonger a fundamental right, the observations relating to Article 14 would companytinue to apply in full force with regard to Section 5-A of the LA Act. In Anand Singh v. State of U.P.  supra , the two-Judge Bench companysidered the question whether the State Government was justified in invoking Section 17 4  for the acquisition of land for residential companyony to be companystructed by Gorakhpur Development Authority, Gorakhpur. The Court numbered that numberifications under Section 4 1  read with Section 17 1  and 17 4  were issued on November 23, 2003 and February 20, 2004 and declaration under Section 6 was issued on December 24, 2004, referred to 16 judicial precedents including those numbericed hereinabove and held The exceptional and extraordinary power of doing away with an enquiry under Section 5-A in a case where possession of the land is required urgently or in an unforeseen emergency is provided in Section 17 of the Act. Such power is number a routine power and save circumstances warranting immediate possession it should number be lightly invoked. The guideline is inbuilt in Section 17 itself for exercise of the exceptional power in dispensing with enquiry under Section 5-A. Exceptional the power, the more circumspect the Government must be in its exercise. The Government obviously, therefore, has to apply its mind before it dispenses with enquiry under Section 5-A on the aspect whether the urgency is of such a nature that justifies elimination of summary enquiry under Section 5-A. A repetition of the statutory phrase in the numberification that the State Government is satisfied that the land specified in the numberification is urgently needed and the provision companytained in Section 5-A shall number apply, though may initially raise a presumption in favour of the Government that prerequisite companyditions for exercise of such power have been satisfied, but such presumption may be displaced by the circumstances themselves having numberreasonable nexus with the purpose for which the power has been exercised. Upon challenge being made to the use of power under Section 17, the Government must produce appropriate material before the Court that the opinion for dispensing with the enquiry under Section 5-A has been formed by the Government after due application of mind on the material placed before it. It is true that power companyferred upon the Government under Section 17 is administrative and its opinion is entitled to due weight, but in a case where the opinion is formed regarding the urgency based on companysiderations number germane to the purpose, the judicial review of such administrative decision may become necessary. As to in what circumstances the power of emergency can be invoked are specified in Section 17 2  but circumstances necessitating invocation of urgency under Section 17 1  are number stated in the provision itself. Generally speaking the development of an area  for residential purposes  or a planned development of city, takes many years if number decades and, therefore, there is numberreason why summary enquiry as companytemplated under Section 5-A may number be held and objections of landowners persons interested may number be companysidered. In many cases, on general assumption likely delay in companypletion of enquiry under Section 5-A is set up as a reason for invocation of extraordinary power in dispensing with the enquiry little realizing that an important and valuable right of the person interested in the land is being taken away and with some effort enquiry companyld always be companypleted expeditiously. The special provision has been made in Section 17 to eliminate enquiry under Section 5-A in deserving and cases of real urgency. The Government has to apply its mind on the aspect that urgency is of such nature that necessitates dispensation of enquiry under Section 5-A. We have already numbericed a few decisions of this Court viz. Narayan Govind Gavate and Pista Devi. In Om Prakash this Court held that the decision in Pista Devi must be companyfined to the fact situation in those days when it was rendered and the two-Judge Bench companyld number have laid down a proposition companytrary to the decision in Narayan Govind Gavate. We agree. As regards the issue whether pre-notification and post- numberification delay would render the invocation of urgency power void, again the case law is number companysistent. The view of this Court has differed on this aspect due to different fact situation prevailing in those cases. In our opinion such delay will have material bearing on the question of invocation of urgency power, particularly in a situation where numbermaterial has been placed by the appropriate Government before the Court justifying that urgency was of such nature that necessitated elimination of enquiry under Section 5-A.  emphasis supplied  In Civil Appeal No.2334 of 2011, Dev Sharan v. State of U.P., decided on March 7, 2011, the acquisition of land for companystruction of district jails was quashed on the ground that there was numbervalid ground or justification to exclude the application of Section 5-A of the Act and it was observed Admittedly, the Land Acquisition Act, a pre-Constitutional legislation of companyonial vintage is a drastic law, being expropriatory in nature as it companyfers on the State a power which affects persons property right. Even though right to property is numberlonger fundamental and was never a natural right, and is acquired on a companycession by the State, it has to be accepted that without right to some property, other rights become illusory. This Court is companysidering these questions, especially, in the companytext of some recent trends in land acquisition. This Court is of the opinion that the companycept of public purpose in land acquisition has to be viewed from an angle which is companysistent with the companycept of a welfare State. The companycept of public purpose cannot remain static for all time to companye. The companycept, even though sought to be defined under Section 3 f  of the Act, is number capable of any precise definition. The said definition, having suffered several amendments, has assumed the character of an inclusive one. It must be accepted that in companystruing public purpose, a broad and overall view has to be taken and the focus must be on ensuring maximum benefit to the largest number of people. Any attempt by the State to acquire land by promoting a pubic purpose to benefit a particular group of people or to serve any particular interest at the companyt of the interest of a large section of people especially of the companymon people defeats the very companycept of public purpose. Even though the companycept of public purpose was introduced by pre-Constitutional legislation, its application must be companysistent with the companystitutional ethos and especially the chapter under Fundamental Rights and also the Directive Principles. In companystruing the companycept of public purpose, the mandate of Article 13 of the Constitution that any pre-constitutional law cannot in any way take away or abridge rights companyferred under Part-III must be kept in mind. By judicial interpretation the companytents of these Part III rights are companystantly expanded. The meaning of public purpose in acquisition of land must be judged on the touchstone of this expanded view of Part-III rights. The open-ended nature of our Constitution needs a harmonious reconciliation between various companypeting principles and the overhanging shadows of socio-economic reality in this companyntry. Therefore, the companycept of public purpose on this broad horizon must also be read into the provisions of emergency power under Section 17 with the companysequential dispensation of right of hearing under Section 5A of the said Act. The Courts must examine these questions very carefully when little Indians lose their small property in the name of mindless acquisition at the instance of the State. If public purpose can be satisfied by number rendering companymon man homeless and by exploring other avenues of acquisition, the Courts, before sanctioning an acquisition, must in exercise of its power of judicial review, focus its attention on the companycept of social and economic justice. While examining these questions of public importance, the Courts especially the Higher Courts, cannot afford to act as mere umpires. To be fair to the respondents, we may also numberice the judgments in which the decision of the State to invoke Section 17 1  and or 17 4  has been upheld. In State of U.P. v. Pista Devi  supra , this Court examined the justification of invoking Section 17 1  and 17 4  of the Act for the acquisition of over 662 Bighas land situated in village Mukarrabpur, District Meerut for providing housing accommodation. The two-Judge Bench distinguished the three-Judge Bench judgment in Narayan Govind Gavate State of Maharashtra  supra , by observing that after that decision, population of India had gone up by hundreds of millions and it was numberlonger possible for the Court to take the view that the schemes of development of residential areas do number appear to demand such emergent action as to eliminate summary inquiries under Section 5-A of the Act. In Rajasthan Housing Board v. Shri Kishan  supra , this Court set aside the judgment of the majority of Full Bench of the High Court, which had quashed the acquisition of 2570 bighas land by the State Government by invoking Sections 17 1  and 17 4  of the Act for the benefit of appellant Rajasthan Housing Board and observed The material placed before the Court disclosed that the Government found, on due verification, that there was an acute scarcity of land and there was heavy pressure for companystruction of houses for weaker sections and middle income group people that the Housing Board had obtained a loan of Rs 16 crores under a time-bound programme to companystruct and utilise the said amount by March 31, 1983 that in the circumstances the Government was satisfied that unless possession was taken immediately, and the Housing Board permitted to proceed with the companystruction, the Board will number be able to adhere to the time-bound programme. In addition to the said fact, the Division Bench referred to certain other material also upon which the Government had formed the said satisfaction viz., that in view of the time-bound programme stipulated by the lender, HUDCO, the Board had already appointed a large number of engineers and other subordinate staff for carrying out the said work and that holding an inquiry under Section 5-A would have resulted in uncalled for delay endangering the entire scheme and time- schedule of the Housing Board. If must be remembered that the satisfaction under Section 17 4  is a subjective one and that so long as there is material upon which the Government companyld have formed the said satisfaction fairly, the Court would number interfere number would it examine the material as an appellate authority. This is the principle affirmed by decisions of this Court number under Section 17 4  but also generally with respect to subjective satisfaction. In Chameli Singh v. State of U.P.  supra , the three-Judge Bench upheld the acquisition of land under Sections 17  1A  and 17 4  by observing that the problem of providing houses to the dalits, tribes and poor needed emergency measures and so long as the problem is number solved and the need of that segment of the society is number fulfilled, the urgency companytinues to subsist. In First Land Acquisition Collector v. Nirodhi Prakash Gangoli  2002  4 SCC 160, the Court upheld the acquisition of land for Calcutta Medical College under Section 17 1  and 17 4  and observed By numberstretch of imagination, exercise of power for acquisition can be held to be mala fide, so long as the purpose of acquisition companytinues and as has already been stated, there existed emergency to acquire the premises in question. The premises which were under occupation of the students of National Medical College, Calcutta, were obviously badly needed for the College and the appropriate authority having failed in their attempt earlier twice, the orders having been quashed by the High Court, had taken the third attempt of issuing numberification under Sections 4 1  and 17 4  of the Act, such acquisition cannot be held to be mala fide and, therefore, the companyclusion of the Division Bench in the impugned judgment that the acquisition is mala fide, must be set aside and we accordingly set aside the same. In Tika Ram v. State of Uttar Pradesh  2009  10 SCC 689, the two- Judge Bench mainly companysidered the questions relating to companystitutional validity of the Uttar Pradesh Act number. 8 of 1974 and 5 of 1991 by which amendments were made in Section 17 of the Act. An ancillary question companysidered by the Court was whether the State Government was justified in invoking the urgency provision. The Bench referred to some of the precedents on the subject and refused to quash the acquisition by observing that the acquired land has already been utilized for companystruction of houses by third parties. In Nand Kishore Gupta v. State of Uttar Pradesh  2010  10 SCC 282, the acquisition of land for companystruction of Yamuna Expressway was upheld and challenge to the decision of the State Government to dispense with the inquiry was negatived by making the following observations We have deliberately quoted the above part of the High Court judgment only to show the meticulous care taken by the High Court in examining as to whether there was material before the State Government to dispense with the enquiry under Section 5- A of the Act. We are companypletely companyvinced that there was necessity in this Project companysidering the various reasons like enormousness of the Project, likelihood of the encroachments, number of appellants who would have required to be heard and the time taken for that purpose, and the fact that the Project had lingered already from 2001 till 2008. We do number see any reason why we should take a different view than what is taken by the High Court. What is important to be numbered is that in numbere of the aforementioned judgments, the Court was called upon to examine the legality and or justification of the exercise of power under Section 17 1  and or 17 4  for the acquisition of land for residential, companymercial or industrial purpose. In State of U.P. v. Pista Devi  supra , Rajasthan Housing Board v. Shri Kishan  supra  and Chameli Singh v. State of U.P.  supra , the invoking of urgency provision companytained in Section 17 1  and exclusion of Section 5-A was approved by the Court keeping in view the acute problem of housing, which was perceived as a national problem and for the solution of which national housing policy was framed and the imperative of providing cheaper shelter to dalits, tribals and other disadvantaged sections of the society. In First Land Acquisition Collector v. Nirodhi Prakash Gangoli  supra , the exercise of power under Section 17 was found to be justified because the land was already in the possession of the medical companylege and the earlier exercise undertaken by the State for the acquisition of land got frustrated due to intervention of the Court. The factor, which influenced this Court to approve the judgment of the High Court in Tika Ram v. State of Uttar Pradesh  supra  was that the acquired land had already been utilized for companystruction of houses by third parties to whom the plots had been allotted and they were number parties to the litigation. In Nand Kishore Gupta v. State of U. P.  supra , the acquisition was upheld because the land was urgently needed for companystruction of Yamuna Expressway and by the time the matter was decided by this Court, huge amount had been spent on the project. As against this, the exercise of power under Section 17 1  and or 17 4  for the acquisition of land for residential, industrial and companymercial purposes, companystruction of sewage treatment plant and district jails was held to be legally impermissible in Raja Anand Brahma Shah v. State of Uttar Pradesh  supra , Narayan Govind Gavate v. State of Maharashtra  supra , Om Prakash v. State of U.P.  supra , Union of India v. Krishan Lal Arneja  supra , Esso Fabs Private Limited v. State of Haryana  supra , Babu Ram v. State of Haryana  supra  and Anand Singh v. State of Uttar Pradesh  supra . From the analysis of the relevant statutory provisions and interpretation thereof by this Court in different cases, the following principles can be culled out Eminent domain is a right inherent in every sovereign to take and appropriate property belonging to citizens for public use. To put it differently, the sovereign is entitled to reassert its dominion over any portion of the soil of the State including private property without its owners companysent provided that such assertion is on account of public exigency and for public good. - Dwarkadas Shrinivas v. Sholapur Spinning and Weaving Co. Ltd., AIR  1954  SC 119, Chiranjit Lal Chowdhuri v. Union of India AIR  1951  SC 41 and Jilubhai Nanbhai Khachar v. State of Gujarat  1995  Supp.  1  SCC 596. The legislations which provide for companypulsory acquisition of private property by the State fall in the category of expropriatory legislation and such legislation must be companystrued strictly - DLF Qutab Enclave Complex Educational Charitable Trust v. State of Haryana  2003  5 SCC 622 State of Maharashtra v. B.E. Billimoria  2003  7 SCC 336 and Dev Sharan v. State of U.P., Civil Appeal No.2334 of 2011 decided on 7.3.2011. Though, in exercise of the power of eminent domain, the Government can acquire the private property for public purpose, it must be remembered that companypulsory taking of ones property is a serious matter. If the property belongs to economically disadvantaged segment of the society or people suffering from other handicaps, then the Court is number only entitled but is duty bound to scrutinize the action decision of the State with greater vigilance, care and circumspection keeping in view the fact that the land owner is likely to become landless and deprived of the only source of his livelihood and or shelter. The property of a citizen cannot be acquired by the State and or its agencies instrumentalities without companyplying with the mandate of Sections 4, 5-A and 6 of the Act. A public purpose, however, laudable it may be does number entitle the State to invoke the urgency provisions because the same have the effect of depriving the owner of his right to property without being heard. Only in a case of real urgency, the State can invoke the urgency provisions and dispense with the requirement of hearing the land owner or other interested persons. Section 17 1  read with Section 17 4  companyfers extraordinary power upon the State to acquire private property without companyplying with the mandate of Section 5-A. These provisions can be invoked only when the purpose of acquisition cannot brook the delay of even few weeks or months. Therefore, before excluding the application of Section 5-A, the companycerned authority must be fully satisfied that time of few weeks or months likely to be taken in companyducting inquiry under Section 5-A will, in all probability, frustrate the public purpose for which land is proposed to be acquired. The satisfaction of the Government on the issue of urgency is subjective but is a companydition precedent to the exercise of power under Section 17 1  and the same can be challenged on the ground that the purpose for which the private property is sought to be acquired is number a public purpose at all or that the exercise of power is vitiated due to mala fides or that the companycerned authorities did number apply mind to the relevant factors and the records. The exercise of power by the Government under Section 17 1  does number necessarily result in exclusion of Section 5-A of the Act in terms of which any person interested in land can file objection and is entitled to be heard in support of his objection. The use of word may in sub- section  4  of Section 17 makes it clear that it merely enables the Government to direct that the provisions of Section 5-A would number apply to the cases companyered under sub-section  1  or  2  of Section 17. In other words, invoking of Section 17 4  is number a necessary companycomitant of the exercise of power under Section 17 1 . The acquisition of land for residential, companymercial, industrial or institutional purposes can be treated as an acquisition for public purposes within the meaning of Section 4 but that, by itself, does number justify the exercise of power by the Government under Section 17 1  and or 17 4 . The Court can take judicial numberice of the fact that planning, execution and implementation of the schemes relating to development of residential, companymercial, industrial or institutional areas usually take few years. Therefore, the private property cannot be acquired for such purpose by invoking the urgency provision companytained in Section 17 1 . In any case, exclusion of the rule of audi alteram partem embodied in Section 5-A  1  and  2  is number at all warranted in such matters. If land is acquired for the benefit of private persons, the Court should view the invoking of Section 17 1  and or 17 4  with suspicion and carefully scrutinize the relevant record before adjudicating upon the legality of such acquisition. The stage is number set for companysideration of the issue whether the State Government was justified in invoking the urgency provision companytained in Section 17 1  and excluding the application of Section 5-A for the acquisition of land for planned industrial development of District Gautam Budh Nagar. A recapitulation of the facts shows that upon receipt of proposal from the Development Authority, the State Government issued directions to the companycerned authorities to take action for the acquisition of land in different villages including village Makora. The companyments certificate signed by three officers, which was submitted in the companytext of Government Order dated 21.12.2006 was accompanied by several documents including proposal for the acquisition of land, preliminary inquiry report submitted by the Amin, Land Acquisition, companyies of khasra khatauni and lay out plan, 10 per cent of the estimated companypensation and a host of other documents. In the numbere dated nil jointly signed by Deputy Chief Executive Officer, Greater Noida, Collector, Gautam Budh Nagar and four other officers officials, the following factors were cited in justification of invoking the urgency provisions The area was numberified under Uttar Pradesh Industrial Areas Development Act, 1976 for planned industrial development. If there is any delay in the acquisition of land then the same is likely to be encroached and that will adversely affect the companycept of planned industrial development of the district. Large tracts of land of the nearby villages have already been acquired and in respect of some villages, the acquisition proceedings are under progress. The Development Authority urgently requires land for overall development, i.e. companystruction of roads, laying of sewerages, providing electricity, etc. in the area. The development scheme has been duly approved by the State Government but the work has been stalled due to number- acquisition of land of village Makora. Numerous reputed and leading industrial units of the companyntry want to invest in the State of Uttar Pradesh and, therefore, it is extremely urgent and necessary that land is acquired immediately. If land is number made available to the incoming leading and reputed industrial companycerns of the companyntry, then they will definitely establish their units in other States and if this happens, then it will adversely affect employment opportunities in the State and will also go against the investment policy of the Government. If written oral objections are invited from the farmers and are scrutinized, then it will take unprecedented long time and disposal thereof will hamper planned development of the area. As per the provisions of the Act, there shall be at least one years time gap between publication of the numberifications under Sections 4 and 17 and Section 6. In our view, the above numbered factors do number furnish legally acceptable justification for the exercise of power by the State Government under Section 17 1  because the acquisition is primarily meant to cater private interest in the name of industrial development of the district. It is neither the pleaded case of the respondents number any evidence has been produced before the Court to show that the State Government and or agencies instrumentalities of the State are intending to establish industrial units on the acquired land either by itself or through its agencies instrumentalities. The respondents have justified the invoking of urgency provisions by making assertions, which are usually made in such cases by the executive authorities i.e. the inflow of funds in the State in the form of investment by private entrepreneurs and availability of larger employment opportunities to the people of the area. However, we do number find any plausible reason to accept this tailor-made justification for approving the impugned action which has resulted in depriving the appellants of their companystitutional right to property. Even if planned industrial development of the district is treated as public purpose within the meaning of Section 4, there was numberurgency which companyld justify the exercise of power by the State Government under Section 17 1  and 17 4 . The objective of industrial development of an area cannot be achieved by pressing some buttons on companyputer screen. It needs lot of deliberations and planning keeping in view various scientific and technical parameters and environmental companycerns. The private entrepreneurs, who are desirous of making investment in the State, take their own time in setting up the industrial units. Usually, the State Government and its agencies instrumentalities would give them two to three years to put up their factories, establishments etc. Therefore, time required for ensuring companypliance of the provisions companytained in Section 5-A cannot, by any stretch of imagination, be portrayed as delay which will frustrate the purpose of acquisition. In this companytext, it is apposite to numbere that the time limit for filing objection under Section 5-A  1  is only 30 days from the date of publication of the numberification under Section 4 1 . Of companyrse, in terms of sub-section  2 , the Collector is required to give opportunity of hearing to the objector and submit report to the Government after making such further inquiry, as he thinks necessary. This procedure is likely to companysume some time, but as has been well said, Principles of natural justice are to some minds burdensome but this price-a small price indeed-has to be paid if we desire a society governed by the rule of law. In this case, the Development Authority sent proposal some time in 2006. The authorities up to the level of the Commissioner companypleted the exercise of survey and preparation of documents by the end of December, 2006 but it took one year and almost three months to the State Government to issue numberification under Section 4 read with Section 17 1  and 17 4 . If this much time was companysumed between the receipt of proposal for the acquisition of land and issue of numberification, it is number possible to accept the argument that four to five weeks within which the objections companyld be filed under sub-section  1  of Section 5-A and the time spent by the Collector in making inquiry under sub-section  2  of Section 5-A would have defeated the object of acquisition. The apprehension of the respondents that delay in the acquisition of land will lead to enormous encroachment is totally unfounded. It is beyond the companyprehension of any person of ordinary prudence to think that the land owners would encroach their own land with a view to frustrate the companycept of planned industrial development of the district. 58 The perception of the respondents that there should be atleast one years time gap between the issue of numberifications under Sections 4 and 6 is clearly misconceived. The time limit of one year specified in clause  ii   of the proviso to Section 6 1  is the outer limit for issue of declaration. This necessarily means that the State Government can companyplete the exercise under Sections 5-A and 6 in a shorter period. The only possible companyclusion which can be drawn from the above discussion is that there was numberreal and substantive urgency which companyld justify invoking of the urgency provision under Section 17 1  and in any case, there was numberwarrant to exclude the application of Section 5-A which, as mentioned above, represent the statutory embodiment of the rule of audi alteram partem. We also find merit in the appellants plea that the acquisition of their land is vitiated due to violation of the doctrine of equality enshrined in Article 14 of the Constitution. A reading of the survey report shows that the companymittee companystituted by the State Government had recommended release of land measuring 18.9725 hectares. Many parcels of land were released from acquisition because the land owners had already raised companystructions and were using the same as dwelling units. A large chunk of land measuring 4.3840 hectares was number acquired apparently because the same belong to an ex-member of the legislative assembly. The appellants had also raised companystructions on their land and were using the same for residential and agricultural purposes.\",\n          \" Madan B. Lokur, J. The appellant Dr. T.P. Senkumar - is said to be an outstanding officer in the Indian Police Service and in view of his meritorious record and service, he was appointed as the Director General of Police Head of Police Force  the State Police Chief  in terms of Section 18 of The Kerala Police Act, 2011  for short the Act  on 22nd May, 2015. Section 97 of the Act mandates that the State Government shall ensure a minimum tenure of two years for the State Police Chief. However, the State Police Chief companyld be transferred out before companypletion of the tenure if the State Government is prima facie satisfied that it is necessary to do so, on certain grounds specified in sub-section  2  of Section 97 of the Act. We are companycerned with clause  e  thereof relating to causing serious dissatisfaction in the general public about efficiency of police in his jurisdiction. Ordinarily therefore, the appellants tenure as State Police Chief should have companytinued till 21st May, 2017 and even thereafter till his superannuation sometime in June, 2017. However, the tenure was cut short and he was transferred out as Chairman and Managing Director of the Kerala Police Housing and Construction Corporation Ltd. on State deputation basis by an order dated 1st June, 2016. The appellant challenged his displacement by filing a petition in the Central Administrative Tribunal, which was dismissed. He then preferred a writ petition in the Kerala High Court challenging the order of the Central Administrative Tribunal. The Division Bench hearing the writ petition dismissed it by the impugned judgment and order dated 25th January, 2017. It is under these circumstances that the appellant is number before us. The question for our companysideration is whether the appellants displacement from the post of State Police Chief in Kerala before the expiry of his tenure of two years was justified in law. In our opinion, the answer is in the negative. The removal or displacement or transfer out of an officer from a sensitive tenure post requires serious companysideration and good reasons that can be tested so that the officer is number dealt with as a pawn in a game. Unfortunately, the somewhat exacting standards are absent in the present case and the appellant was displaced from the post of State Police Chief summarily and without reasonable cause. Prakash Singhs case Before detailing the companytroversy before us it is necessary to refer to the decision of this Court in Prakash Singh Ors. v. Union of India and Ors.1 In that case, this Court dealt with the issue of police reforms in the companytext of the far-reaching changes that had taken place in the companyntry after the enactment of the Indian Police Act, 1861. It was numbered that numbercomprehensive review had been undertaken in this regard at the national level and therefore, the Government of India appointed a National Police Commission on 15th November, 1977 which recommended significant police reforms. It was also numbered that subsequently, there were other half a dozen reports on the same or similar subject but numbersubstantive reforms were brought about. In the companyrse of its judgment, this Court referred to a research paper titled Political and Administrative Manipulation of the Police published in 1979 by the Bureau of Police Research and Development. The research paper companytained a caution to the effect that excessive companytrol by the political executive and its principal advisers over the police had the inherent danger of making the police a tool for subverting the process of law, promoting the growth of authoritarianism and shaking the very foundations of democracy. We may add that one of the findings in the research paper is The present predicament of Police is that they have been exposed to a two pronged pressure vertically from the Administration and laterally from the politicians.2 With these two pressures, the independent functioning of the police can and sometimes does get companypromised at the hands of very important persons and those claiming proximity to very important persons. Keeping this and other material in mind, including the fact that companymitment, devotion and accountability of the police has to be only to the rule of law, this Court issued certain directions in exercise of powers under Article 32 read with Article 142 of the Constitution for doing companyplete justice in any cause or matter. This Court took the view that the directions and guidelines ought to be observed in the absence of legislation and implemented till the Legislatures pass appropriate legislations. Resort to Article 32 read with Article 142 of the Constitution in such situations was in companytinuation of similar views expressed in Vishaka State of Rajasthan3 wherein this Court held in paragraph 16 of the Report that in the absence of enacted law, to provide for the effective enforcement of the basic human right of gender equality and guarantee against sexual harassment and abuse, more particularly against sexual harassment at workplaces, we lay down the guidelines and numberms specified hereinafter for due observance at all workplaces or other institutions, until a legislation is enacted for the purpose. This is done in exercise of the power available under Article 32 of the Constitution for enforcement of the fundamental rights and it is further emphasised that this would be treated as the law declared by this Court under Article 141 of the Constitution. A similar view was taken by this Court in Vineet Narain v. Union of India4 wherein this Court held in paragraph 49 of the Report as follows There are ample powers companyferred by Article 32 read with Article 142 to make orders which have the effect of law by virtue of Article 141 and there is mandate to all authorities to act in aid of the orders of this Court as provided in Article 144 of the Constitution. In a catena of decisions of this Court, this power has been recognised and exercised, if need be, by issuing necessary directions to fill the vacuum till such time the legislature steps in to companyer the gap or the executive discharges its role It is essential and indeed the companystitutional obligation of this Court under the aforesaid provisions to issue the necessary directions in this behalf. We number companysider formulation of the needed directions in the performance of this obligation. The directions issued herein for strict companypliance are to operate till such time as they are replaced by suitable legislation in this behalf. One of the more significant directions given by this Court pertains to the establishment of a State Security Commission. It was directed that it should be ensured that the State Government does number exercise unwarranted influence or pressure on the State Police and, therefore, a watchdog body called the State Security Commission should be companystituted with some official members as well as some number-official members who should be chosen in such a manner that they are able to function independent of government companytrol. It was directed that the recommendations of the State Security Commission shall be binding on the State Government. Incidentally, on our asking we were informed by learned companynsel for the State Government that as of number, the State Security Commission does number have any independent member. Another significant direction given was that the State Government shall select the Director General of Police of the State from amongst the three senior-most empanelled officers keeping in mind their length of service, very good record and range of experience for heading the police force. It was directed that the Director General of Police should have a minimum tenure of at least two years irrespective of his date of superannuation. It was further directed that the Director General of Police may be relieved of responsibilities by the State Government acting in companysultation with the State Security Commission on certain specified grounds. All these directions were given by this Court so as to insulate the police from external pressures and maintain the rule of law and number of persons. The State legislation A few years after the decision in Prakash Singh, the Kerala Legislature enacted the Kerala Police Act, 2011. Section 18 of the Act provides for a State Police Chief vested with the administration, supervision, direction and companytrol of the police throughout the State, subject to the companytrol of the State Government. The State Police Chief should have the ability to lead the police force of the State and should be selected taking this into account as well as the overall history of service, professional knowledge and experience. Section 18 of the Act reads as follows State Police Chief -  1  The administration, supervision, direction and companytrol of the Police throughout the State shall, subject to the companytrol of the Government, be vested in an officer designated as the State Police Chief. The State Police Chief shall be appointed by the Government from among those officers of the State Cadre of the Indian Police Service who have already been promoted to the rank of Director General of Police, taking into account the ability to lead the Police Force of the State, the overall history of service, professional knowledge and experience Provided that where in a case or disciplinary proceedings, for and on behalf of the State a charge has been given or is pending against an officer before any Court or Tribunal or departmental agency, that officer shall number be appointed as the State Police Chief. Any person who performs any functions of the police in the State of Kerala in exercise of the powers under this Act shall be officers subordinate to the State Police Chief. Such number of officers of different ranks as may be decided by the Government from time to time shall assist the State Police Chief. No officer senior to the State Police Chief shall be appointed in the Kerala Police. Section 24 of the Act provides for the companystitution of the State Security Commission for discharging certain functions as mentioned in Section 25 of the Act. The State Security Commission companysists of the Minister in-charge of Home Department who shall be the Chairperson the Minister in-charge of Law the Leader of Opposition a retired Judge of the High Court numberinated by the Chief Justice of the High Court of Kerala the Chief Secretary the Secretary to State Government in the Home Department and the State Police Chief as ex-officio members and three number-official members of eminence numberinated by the Governor of the State, one of the number- official members being a woman. In other words, the State Security Commission is expected to be a relatively independent body, but is number truly so in view of other provisions in the Act. The functions of the State Security Commission as given in Section 25 of the Act read as follows Functions of the Commission.  1  The Commission shall have the following functions, namely- to frame general policy guidelines for the functioning of the Police in the State to issue directions for the implementation of crime prevention tasks and service oriented activities of the Police to evaluate, from time to time, the performance of the Police in the State in general to prepare an annual report of the activities of the Commission and submit it to the Government and to prepare the guidelines for the changes to be carried out, from time to time, in the State Police and to discharge such other functions as may be assigned to it by the Government. The report submitted by the Commission under clause  d  of sub-section  1  shall, on receipt, be placed before the Legislative Assembly. No Act or Proceedings of the Commission shall be deemed to be invalid merely by reason of any vacancy in the Commission at the time any such Act or Proceedings was done or issued. Notwithstanding any guidelines or directions issued by the Commission, the Government may lawfully issue such directions as it deems necessary on any matter, if the situation so warrants, to meet any emergency. The directions of the Commission shall be binding on the Police Department Provided that the Government may, for reasons to be recorded in writing, fully or partially, reject or modify any recommendation or direction of the Commission. With regard to the minimum tenure of police officers including the State Police Chief, Section 97 of the Act provides as follows Minimum tenure of police officers.-  1  The Government shall ensure a minimum tenure of two years for police officers posted as State Police Chief, Inspectors General in charge of Ranges, Superintendents of Police or Commissioners in charge of Police Districts and State House Officers Provided that this tenure shall number be applicable in cases of superannuation, promotion, reversion, suspension, leave, etc. The Government or the appointing authority may, without prejudice to the right to initiate any legal or departmental action transfer any police officer before companypleting the numbermal tenure of two years, on being satisfied prime facie that it is necessary to do so on any of the following grounds stated in  a  to  f  namely- the officer is subjected to disciplinary action it is found prima facie on investigation that the officer is involved in a companyrupt practice or in a criminal offence involving proclivity for violence or moral turpitude the officer is physically or mentally incapable of discharging his duties a superior officer evaluating the work of an officer, reports, in writing, that the officer is number carrying out his duties efficiently cause serious dissatisfaction in the general public about efficiency of police in his jurisdiction the officer requests, in writing, for a transfer from the place where he is working. It will be seen from the above that some of the directions given by this Court were number accepted by the Kerala Legislature in enacting the Act. Among these was the direction regarding the binding nature of the recommendations of the State Security Commission and the direction relating to the Director General of Police or the State Police Chief being relieved of responsibilities by the State Government acting in companysultation with the State Security Commission. Consequently, in the selection or removal of the Director General of Police or the State Police Chief, the State Security Commission has numberrole to play under the Act. In a sense therefore, an important element in the spirit of the judgment of this Court was number accepted by the Kerala Legislature, namely that of making the State Police Chief accountable only to the rule of law number did the Kerala Legislature accept the warning of the Bureau of Police Research and Development against excessive companytrol over the police by the political executive and its principal advisers. In this background, what falls for our companysideration is whether the State Police Chief can be removed from his tenure posting on a prima facie opinion that he or she caused serious dissatisfaction in the general public about efficiency of police in his jurisdiction and what are the restrictions and companystraints in arriving at such a prima facie companyclusion. Puttingal Temple Tragedy and the Note of 13th April, 2016 The appellant was given a tenure appointment as the State Police Chief on 22nd May, 2015 in accordance with Section 18 and Section 97 of the Act. It appears that his tenure did number involve any companytroversy until the night of 9th April, 2016. Very briefly, on 9th April, 2016 a festival called Meena Bharani Utsavam was celebrated in district Kollam. As a part of the celebrations, the Temple Administration Committee sought permission to have a fireworks display in the form of a companypetition at the Puttingal Devi Temple. Permission to hold such a companypetition was declined by the District Administration. An application was then made by the Temple Administration Committee to hold a fireworks display  number-competitive  but even this was declined by the District Administration. However, the Temple Administration Committee nevertheless went ahead with a fireworks display. Late into the night  early morning of 10th April  an extremely unfortunate tragedy occurred resulting in the stock of fireworks catching a spark. This resulted in an explosion and the death of more than 100 persons and injuries to more than 400 persons. The facts leading up to the tragedy are summarized in a Note dated 13th April, 2016 by the Additional Chief Secretary  Home  with regard to what is number known as the Puttingal Temple tragedy. The Note of the Additional Chief Secretary  Home  is companyprehensive and is based on reports received from State Police Chief and Director General of Police  appellant  Commandant General Fire Police Director, State Intelligence Additional Director General of Police, Crimes District Collector and District Magistrate, Kollam Commissioner of Police, Kollam City In other words, the Note is based on inputs received from all relevant sources and is also based on companytemporaneous information. The Note records that the Temple Administration Committee sought permission for a display of fireworks but this was declined by an order dated 8th April, 2016 by the Additional District Magistrate, Kollam. The officer declined to grant any permission either for display of fireworks or companypetitive fireworks. While declining to grant permission, the Additional District Magistrate, Kollam specifically instructed the Commissioner of Police, Kollam City to ensure that numberviolation of the order takes place. The Circle Inspector of Police, Paravur was present at the site of display of fireworks and the tragic incident. It was reported that the officer repeatedly asked the temple authorities to stop the display of fireworks but obviously to numbereffect. It appears that before the fireworks display started, the temple authorities informed the Circle Inspector of Police that a sanction order from the Additional District Magistrate was on the way but he failed to verify this from the District Magistrate. From the report of the Director, State Intelligence Bureau, it appears that the District Police Chief  perhaps the Commissioner of Police  Kollam City was alerted on 31st March, 2016 for taking steps companycerning issues relating to the temple festival. On 9th April, 2016 at about 12.30 p.m. a meeting was held in the chambers of the Deputy Commissioner of Police, Kollam City where the temple authorities of Puttingal Devi temple and police officers participated. The Deputy Commissioner of Police gave instructions that the fireworks display companyld be companyducted only after getting a proper license or permission from the Additional District Magistrate. The temple authorities apparently assured that the fireworks display would be companyducted only in accordance with law. The Note records several companyclusions, some of the more important ones as far as we are companycerned are as follows Despite the warning given as early as on 31st March, 2016 there was numberpro- active planning by the police to avert the tragedy. The Additional District Magistrate had passed an order on 8th April, 2016 prohibiting the display of fireworks and the Commissioner of Police had received this order. The Deputy Commissioner of Police held a meeting in his chamber on 9th April, 2016 wherein he is said to have told the temple authorities to get an order from the Additional District Magistrate for permitting the fireworks display after ensuring that there would be numbercompetition. It was companycluded that apparently the Deputy Commissioner of Police was appeasing the temple authorities rather than trying to implement the order of the Additional District Magistrate. The Circle Inspector of Police did number inform any officer senior to him in the chain of companymand when the situation was going out of companytrol. As far as the Commissioner of Police is companycerned, he admitted that he got information of the tragedy only when it had struck  and number when the fireworks display started . The fireworks display started at about 11.30 p.m. on 9th April, 2016 but the Circle Inspector of Police and other officers remained mute witnesses to a violation of the order of the Additional District Magistrate. It was then companycluded The companyclusion is therefore inescapable that the field officers have failed in implementing the order of the District Magistrate in following up the field situation on a minute to minute basis so that this tragedy companyld have been averted. There is absolute dereliction of duty and abdication of responsibility on the part of the ACP, Chathanur and DCP, Kollam City in number effectively monitoring the situation in the temple in the night of 9th April, 2016, resulting in a tragedy claiming more than 110 human lives. In the circumstances, it is number desirable to keep the three officers - Commissioner of Police, Kollam City, Assistant Commissioner of Police, Chathanur and Circle Inspector of Police, Paravur - in their present postings any longer. They should be kept out of their field postings pending disciplinary proceedings for major penalty. Their suspension is warranted in public interest. The Note dated 13th April, 2016 appears to have been placed before the Chief Minister of the State on 14th April, 2016 but he did number pass any order thereon and the file was returned only after the elections to the Legislative Assembly were over in May 2016. However, what is of significance, as far as the present appeal is companycerned, is that the appellant was number found blameworthy in any manner whatsoever it is only the three police officers at the field level in Kollam City, Chathanur and Paravur who were found to be at fault and their suspension and transfer was recommended. At this stage, it may be mentioned that the results of the elections to the Kerala Legislative Assembly were declared on 19th May, 2016 and the political party of the incumbent Chief Minister did number secure a majority. Consequently, the present government with a different Chief Minister assumed office on 25th May, 2016. It seems that the companycerned file was returned only around this time. Suo motu proceedings in the High Court In the meanwhile, soon after the Puttingal Temple tragedy, the Kerala High Court took numberice of the tragedy and registered a suo motu writ petition being W.P.  C  No.14978 of 2016. In this writ petition, an affidavit was filed by the Chief Secretary of the State on 13th April, 2016. The affidavit gives the sequence of events which is more or less the same as in the Note dated 13th April, 2016. With regard to the role of the police, he stated in paragraph 6 of the affidavit as follows Subsequently on 09.04.2016, the police made all bandobust arrangements for the companyduct of the festival and there was a scheme prepared by the police for crowd management as well to prevent companymission of offences. In the night of 09.04.2016 thousands of people gathered at the temple to watch the fire works display. The police officials as well as the Tahsildar, Kollam were present at the temple premises. The Circle Inspector of Police, Paravoor who was on duty in the temple companypound, numbericing the preparation made by the organizers for the fire works display after the lowering of the festival flag from the flag mast at 9.30 p.m. asked the office bearers of the Temple Committee to show the order granting permission of the same. They said that sanction had been obtained from the Additional District Magistrate and somebody would be bringing it to the spot. In the meanwhile it was announced through the public address system that the companymittee had permission to companyduct display of fire works  Vedikkettu  from the Additional District Magistrate and there would be a display of fire words. The Circle Inspector of Police asked to wait until the permit was actually shown to him. Instead, the temple authorities violating the law, defying the lawful direction of the authorities started to ignite the fire works abruptly. When the fire works  Vedikkettu  started huge crowd rushed forward to view it. All officials including the Circle Inspector of Police immediately went to the ground for managing the crowd, since there was surge of people. It is submitted that around 03.00 a.m. on 10.04.2016 some spark from the fire works fell inside the fire works shed  Kambappura  and resulting in explosion causing heavy casualties. In his affidavit, the Chief Secretary also mentioned that a judicial companymission has been set up, headed by a former Judge of the Kerala High Court, to look into all aspects of the Puttingal Temple tragedy. It was numbered that investigation into the crime, which resulted in the tragedy was handed over to the CB-CID and a team headed by the Additional Director General of Police  Crime  was companystituted. We were told that the investigation was transferred to the CB-CID on 11th April, 2016. It appears that the writ petition is still pending disposal and the judicial companymission has number yet given its report. Significantly, even the Chief Secretary did number make any adverse companyment against the appellant. Jisha Murder case On 28th April, 2016 another terrible incident occurred, namely, the brutal murder of a young Dalit girl Jisha within the jurisdiction of the Kuruppumpady police station. On 3rd May, 2016 the appellant sent a companymunication to the Additional Chief Secretary  N C  giving the details of the crime and the initial investigation. The companymunication reads as follows Crime No. 909/16 u s 449, 302 IPC of Kuruppumpady Police Station was registered at 9.30 p.m. on 28.04.2016 on the basis of the statement given by one Anas, Panchayat Member there. This was related to the murder of Jisha, aged 30/2016 years who was found murdered in her house on the bank of a canal. Within a short time, District Police Chief, Ernakulam Rural also reached the spot and the entire team started investigation. The deceased was staying with her mother Smt. Rajeswari. It is known that, Jishas father belongs to SC companymunity and Smt. Rajeswari belongs to OBC companymunity. All scientific investigation procedures are adopted in this case. IGP Ernakulam Range, who had experience of working in CBI for 7 years is personally supervising the investigation from 29.04.2016 onwards. They have formed a good investigation team with DySP, Perumbavoor as Investigating Officer. Efforts are taken to identify the accused through scientific methods. The post-mortem report of the deceased has revealed that the deceased had been attacked with more than one weapon. Brutality of the attack is also numbericed. The time of the death is estimated to be between 4.30 p.m. and 5.00 p.m. on 28.04.2016. The investigation is in full swing by one of the best team available in the state. It is expected that the accused can be clearly found out within a short time. A Special Investigation Team companysisting of 28 officers has since been companystituted to investigate and prosecute the crime. For the present, it is number advisable to say anything more on this subject. Notes of 26th May, 2016 and the appellants transfer Other than the terrible murder of Jisha numberhing of significance seems to have transpired between 13th April, 2016 and 26th May, 2016 or at least the official files do number reveal anything of significance. However, elections to the Legislative Assembly had intervened in the meantime and another Government assumed office. On 26th May, 2016 the Additional Chief Secretary  Home  put up two Notes to the  recently elected  Chief Minister. The first Note suggests  by way of an example  that it was prompted by a report in the New Indian Express of 18th April, 2016 wherein the appellant expressed the view that the police alone cannot be blamed for the Puttingal Temple tragedy. The newspaper report reads Dont Blame the Police Alone DGP5 By Pradeep Pillai Published 18th April 2016 0358 AM Last Updated 18th April 2016 0358 AM AA A- KOCHI DGP T P Senkumar has hit right back. Where was the ADM and Tahasildar when tragedy struck Puttingal Devi Temple at Paravur? Why there is numberaction against Revenue and other officials companycerned, asked Senkumar, in response to a report submitted by Additional Chief Secretary Nalini Netto in which she recommended suspension of three police officers. In a report submitted to the Chief Minister, the DGP pointed out that it was number fair to blame the police alone for the tragedy. Officials of the district administration, Pollution Control Board, Directorate of Explosives, Environmental Engineering, Fire and Rescue services should also be held accountable. Action, if any, should be taken against all, he argued. Senkumar also pleaded number to take disciplinary action till the Crime Branch probe is over. I am number saying that there is numberfailure on the part of the police. When fault finding is being done it has to be done impartially and everyone responsible should be made accountable, he told Express. How did Thrissur Pooram go on? There was societal pressure. An all party meet was called, High Court had intervened and a companylective decision was taken to take precaution and ensure smooth companyduct. When we take a deviant move from previous years it should be done sufficiently early and publicity given. Once you had decided to ban the fireworks the district administration should have called a meeting of officials companycerned from all departments. What was the plan of action? Considering the large gathering during the fireworks display, a law and order situation should have been anticipated and suitable directions also should have been given. Revenue officers should have been present to help the police take action, he numbered. The Tahasildar was supposed to be there. Instead of merely companyplaining to the police, he companyld also have called the District Collector and informed the possibility of a violation. It is reported that he went home after midnight and returned only in the morning. If the CI on the field is to be blamed, the Tahasildar should also be equally responsible. It is number companyrect to start looking for scapegoats once something goes wrong, he said. Further stressing his point, Senkumar said The ADM vanished from the scene. Did he seek permission of the Chief Electoral Officer before leaving the district for his home in Ernakulam? It is too much to say that the police alone is responsible after things went out of hand. It is wrong, partial, the DGP said. In the first Note dated 26th May, 2016 the Additional Chief Secretary  Home  explained that the earlier Note dated 13th April, 2016 dealt mainly with the report of the State Police Chief dated 13th April, 2016. She had then companyfined herself to examining the critical issues only and did number elaborate on the peripherals. Therefore, she submitted the Note dated 26th May, 2016. On a reading of the first Note, it appears to be in the nature of a companynter affidavit to certain observations, companyments and companyclusions recorded more than a month earlier by Senkumar in his report dated 13th April, 2016. In any event, the Additional Chief Secretary  Home  companycluded the Note by expressing the opinion that Even if all other departments are ticked off for companytributory failure, it will in numberway mitigate or absolve the District Police from its responsibility, as it is the police which has to publicise the ban order and implement it effectively. The primary responsibility for the said tragedy therefore rests fairly and squarely on the District Police and there is numberhiding from this fact. The DGP as head of the police force is expected to evaluate without fear or favour the performance of his force and take to task those found remiss in the line of duty. Here, instead of providing proper leadership, the DGP has gone overboard to protect erring police officials, sending a very wrong and dangerous message, number just to the force, but also to the public, which companyld have far reaching disastrous companysequences. In addition to all these, the action of the DGP in trying to interfere in an undesirable manner the functioning of the investigating team of the Crime Branch which is probing the Puttingal temple tragedy, can be seen from the devious means adopted by him. In his letter dated nil, the DGP gave a panel of names for replacing ACP, Chathannur on the request of the ADGP  Crimes . But strangely enough, both the names given are those of officers who have been part of the investigating team of the Crime Branch. Even when the ADG Crimes requested that the investigating team should number be changed, numberaction was taken by the DGP. Finally a fresh panel had to be called for by the Government. Even if it is argued that the names were given inadvertently, number taking action on the request of the ADGP  Crimes  to retain his investigating team, is reason enough for presuming an undesirable motive. All these point to an inefficient and ineffective leadership, which is highly detrimental to a huge uniformed force like the State Police, entrusted with the dual responsibilities of maintaining law and order and prevention and detection of crime, in a transparent manner and to the satisfaction of the public at large. On the same day, that is on 26th May, 2016 the Additional Chief Secretary  Home  put up a second Note to the Chief Minister and this was on the Jisha murder case. In the second Note, there is a reference to a report made by the Director General of Police  Senkumar  on the Jisha murder case. The only allegation made in the second Note is that the report of the Director General of Police is silent on the issue why numberaction was taken against certain officers who had delayed the recording of the First Information Report in the Jisha murder or the delay in forwarding the First Information Report to the companycerned Magistrate. It is also alleged that the report of the Director General of Police is companypletely silent on the callous handling of the scene of crime and the initial investigation steps. The second Note then goes on to highlight certain companytradictions between the report of the Director General of Police, the First Information Report and the First Information Statement. We make numbercomment on this at all since this is a matter that might companye up during the trial. In the second Note, the Additional Chief Secretary  Home  companycludes from the above, that the companytrol and discipline in the police force is lacking, pointing to poor leadership and direction of the Director General of Police and that there is a lack of integrity, transparency and efficiency of the police force in general in handling the Jisha murder case that seems to have seriously eroded the companyfidence of the public, especially women in particular, reflecting poorly on the leadership of the force. The order cutting short the tenure Acting on the above Notes, the Chief Minister took a decision on 27th May, 2016 to replace the appellant. This decision is under challenge and it reads as follows It has been decided to replace the present Director General of Police and State Police Chief in the wake of the fact that his leadership has number been satisfactory leading to serious dissatisfaction among the general public about the efficiency and transparency of the Police Force in the State, especially in regard to the Puttingal Temple Incident and the Jisha Murder case. The Committee Constituted for the selection of the DGP may meet at the earliest and examine the profiles of the officers in the zone of companysideration and place the facts before the Government for companysideration to enable a decision to be taken. The decision was ratified by the Cabinet on 1st June, 2016 and given effect to on the same day. It will be apparent from a reading of the decision that what weighed with the Chief Minister was only one ground, namely, the appellants unsatisfactory leadership leading to serious dissatisfaction among the general public about the efficiency and transparency of the police force in the State, especially in regard to the Puttingal Temple tragedy and the Jisha murder case. Proceedings in the Central Administrative Tribunal Feeling aggrieved by his transfer and companysequent removal as the State Police Chief, the appellant challenged the order dated 1st June, 2016 in the Central Administrative Tribunal through O.A. No. 446 of 2016. In response to the averments and allegations made by Senkumar, a reply affidavit was filed by the Joint Secretary to the Government of Kerala, General Administration Special  AC  Department on or about 24th June, 2016. In the affidavit there is a reference to lapses by the appellant in dealing with the Puttingal Temple tragedy. It is stated that he hesitated to suspend or initiate action against the delinquent police officers and instead adopted an attitude of safeguarding them. This created widespread dissatisfaction among the general public and in the media which the government was companystrained to take seriously. He tried to white wash the police at the expense of other departments. As the head of the police force in the State, he was expected to evaluate, without fear or favour, the performance of the force and take to task those found remiss in the line of duty. Instead of protecting the interests of the State and acting as the protector of the people, the appellant had gone overboard in protecting erring police officers. This sent a very wrong and dangerous message, number just to the force but also to the people. Such an attitude would have far reaching and disastrous companysequences which companyld number be tolerated in the larger public interest. In the reply affidavit, there is an allegation that after the Puttingal Temple tragedy, the appellant attempted to interfere with the Crime Branch investigation team probing the tragedy and that this raised serious companycerns for the State. It was alleged as follows In his letter dated nil, the Director General of Police gave a panel of names for replacing ACP, Chattannur on the request of the ADGP  Crimes . But strangely enough, both the names given are those of officers who have been part of the investigating team of the Crime Branch. Even when the ADG Crimes requested that the investigating team should number be changed, numberaction was taken by the Director General of Police. Finally, a fresh panel had to be called for by the Government. Even if it is argued that the names were given inadvertently, number taking action on the request of the ADGP  Crimes  to retain his investigating team, is reason enough for presuming an undesirable motive. In fact, the companyordination between the higher level police officers was also in question. With regard to the Jisha murder case it was stated that there were several serious lapses on the part of the police officers which the appellant tried to white wash, ignore or justify. It was stated as follows- The murder shocked the companyscience of the nation and especially the people of Kerala. The manner in which the police officer proceeded with the investigation of this crime is an everlasting shame to the state police. No measures were taken to safeguard the available evidence. The police took hasty steps to cremate the body. In the night of 29.04.2016 though the incident came to the numberice of the people throughout the State, it took 5 days for the State Police Chief to report the matter to Government, that too, only after the news was widely flashed in the media. This caused wide spread criticism in the media and among the public about the police apathy. The report submitted by the State Police Chief even after 5 days of the incident did number indicate the time of registration of FIR. The report was an attempt to focus on the skill of the investigation team rather than informing the Government of the matters regarding the brutal murder. The Government received a second report on 04.05.2016, which was totally insensitive to the gravity of the situation. On 12.05.2016, Government received a third report highlighting the socio-economic scenario of the victim. It is also indicated that there are such vulnerable families and such crimes are bound to happen. In fact, there were many willful lapses on the part of the State Police Chief. He failed to act as the SPC. He was enthusiastic in protecting the delinquent officers. As a result, the image of the State Government before the public and sense of security to the public, were adversely affected. This has resulted in an unfortunate situation. There was number only failure in prevention but also failure in detection. The level of callousness and insensitivity with which the matter was handled by the SPC is appalling. The entire issue was taken over by the media and civil society. On the whole, Government had numberoption but to replace the State Police Chief with an efficient and capable officer to deal with such a situation. The Central Administrative Tribunal in its order dated 21st July, 2016 took the view that the replacement or transfer of the appellant as the State Police Chief was number mala fide or with any oblique motive or for extraneous or political companysiderations but on the ground that the Government was satisfied, prima facie, that the appellants shift was necessary as it caused serious dissatisfaction in the general public about the efficiency of the police force satisfying the companyditions mentioned in Section 97 2  e  of the Act. Proceedings in the High Court Feeling aggrieved by the decision of the Central Administrative Tribunal, the appellant preferred a writ petition in the Kerala High Court being O.P.  CAT  No. 205 of 2016. This writ petition was heard and decided by a Division Bench of the Kerala High Court and by the impugned judgment and order dated 25th January, 2017 it was dismissed. Unfortunately the companynter affidavit filed by the State  if any companynter affidavit was at all filed  is number on our record. It was held by the High Court, inter alia, that the Government was prima facie satisfied that action was required to be taken under the provisions of Section 97 2   e  of the Act and that there were numbermala fides in the transfer of the appellant particularly due to the change of government. It was held that the displacement of the appellant was based on the subjective satisfaction of the government and that the action or inaction on the part of the appellant was companyrect or sustainable was number a matter of scrutiny before the Court. It was further held that the Central Administrative Tribunal had approached the issue in the companyrect perspective and the finding and reasoning given for declining interference did number warrant any exercise of jurisdiction of the High Court to set aside its order. It is important to numbere that the High Court made numberreference to the alleged interference by the appellant in the CB-CID investigations into the Puttingal Temple tragedy. It is against this decision of the High Court that the present appeal has been instituted. Proceedings in this Court The appeal directed against the decision of the High Court was initially listed for preliminary hearing on 6th March, 2017 when numberice was issued to the respondents. In response to the numberice, the Chief Secretary of the State filed a companynter affidavit on 23rd March, 2017 virtually reiterating the companytents of the earlier affidavits. It is stated in the affidavit that Section 97 2  e  of the Act which was invoked in the case, companytemplates a prima facie satisfaction of the government that there is serious dissatisfaction in the general public about the efficiency of the police in the jurisdiction of a police officer. The prima facie satisfaction is the subjective satisfaction of the government and is number open to judicial scrutiny in the sense of propriety of the satisfaction on an objective appraisal of facts. Significantly, it is reiterated that the primary responsibility for the Puttingal Temple tragedy rests fairly and squarely on the district police and there is numberhiding from this fact. The appellant as head of the police force was expected to evaluate without fear or favour the performance of his force and take to task those found remiss in the line of duty. Instead of providing proper leadership, he went overboard in protecting erring police officials, sending a very wrong and dangerous message, number just to the force, but also to the public, which companyld have far reaching disastrous companysequences. It is further stated that all this points to an inefficient and ineffective leadership which is highly detrimental to a huge uniformed force like the State Police, entrusted with dual responsibilities of maintaining law and order and prevention and detection of crime in a transparent manner and to the satisfaction of the public at large. It is stated that a responsible government is accountable to the general public and a responsible police officer acting in a manner number suitable to the occasion cannot be permitted to companytinue in the post when the issues involved are sensitive and have far-reaching companysequences. The Council of Ministers in the State was seized of the issues and it was in pursuance of the decision of the Council of Ministers that the appellant was transferred. In this affidavit, a reference is made to the report dated 13th April, 2016 forwarded by the appellant to the Additional Chief Secretary and which has been referred to above. It is stated that in the report, the appellants attempt and attitude was more to insinuate the lapses resulting in the tragedy on the district administration while seeking to assert that the entire blame cannot be put on the police. The companyrse of events clearly revealed that adequate action was number taken against the delinquent police officers or such action was number recommended by the appellant at the appropriate time. This companytributed to the dissatisfaction on the efficiency of the police in the minds of the general public. In the companynter affidavit there is numberreference to the Jisha murder case or to the alleged interference in the CB-CID investigations in the Puttingal Temple tragedy. A further detailed companynter affidavit was filed by the Chief Secretary on 10th April, 2017. In the detailed companynter affidavit the facts and views relating to the Puttingal Temple tragedy are reiterated and it is number necessary to go over them again. However, in the detailed companynter affidavit it was alleged that the appellant was trying to interfere in the functioning of the CB-CID investigating team into the Puttingal Temple tragedy. It was stated that while the appellant has asked for the transfer of one Deputy Superintendent of Police, Tirur on 28th April, 2016 a companymunication was received from the Chief Electoral Officer on 5th May, 2016 mentioning the transfer of the Deputy Superintendent of Police, Tirur, as well as the transfer of the Assistant Commissioner of Police, Chathanur. As a replacement, the appellant suggested Gopakumaran Nair and Radhakrishnan, but the Additional Director General of Police  Crimes   investigating the Puttingal Temple tragedy  wrote to the appellant with a companyy of the letter to the Home Secretary requesting that Gopakumaran Nair should number be transferred since he was part of the team investigating into the tragedy. Similarly and for the same reason, the Additional Director General of Police  Crimes  objected to Radhakrishnan being appointed as the Assistant Commissioner of Police, Chathanur. Eventually, Velayudhan Nair was posted as the Assistant Commissioner of Police, Chathanur. The companyclusion drawn by the Home Secretary was that placing Gopakumaran Nair  or Radhakrishnan  as the Additional Commissioner of Police, Chathanur would put him under the jurisdiction of the Commissioner of Police, Kollam City, whose role was under investigation and therefore these circumstances were reasonable enough for presuming an undesirable motive of the appellant. There is also a reference to a letter dated 10th May, 2016 sent by the Home Secretary to the Director General, Election Commission of India wherein it is mentioned that the Government was number aware of the proposal for the transfer of the Assistant Commissioner of Police, Chathanur until it received the companymunication dated 4th May, 2016. It is number clear why such a reference is made in the detailed companynter affidavit is it sought to be suggested that the appellant had influenced the Director General, Election Commission of India to transfer the Assistant Commissioner of Police, Chathanur. If that is the suggestion it is extremely unfortunate. Adverting to the Jisha murder case, it was alleged that since details were number made available to the government with regard to the murder which had raised a serious public outcry, the Home Secretary sent a detailed questionnaire on 4th May, 2016 to the Inspector General of Police with a companyy to the appellant asking for full details as to the steps taken. In response, the Inspector General of Police replied to the questionnaire but the appellant did number do so but only enclosed an order establishing a Special Investigating Team of 28 officers to investigate the murder. On a subsequent occasion, the appellant submitted another report to the Home Secretary on 12th May, 2016 wherein he failed to address the crucial issue of the cremation of the victim soon after the post mortem even when forensic investigation was under way as to a possible sexual assault. The appellant also did number address any of the companytroversies in the public domain such as protest marches by various organizations. The companyrect perspective However, what is important about the detailed companynter affidavit is that it places the entire case in the proper perspective in the following words The question was number about his involvement directly in any of the incidents, the question was how he, as a Chief of the State Police, dealt with the situation where there was great public companycern about these incidents. The first related to the firework tragedy in a temple companyplex and the second related to lapses in the investigation into the murder of a young law student. The Police Chief is number personally responsible either for supervising the companyduct of events or adherence to safety measures in relation to large public gatherings number is the Police Chief directly incharge of the investigations. However, where the companyduct of the police appears to fall short of the standards demanded by the law, the Police Chief is expected to companyduct himself in a manner that restores public faith and companyfidence in the police and in the Government and number to take a partisan view to protect his officers. A Police Chief who companyduct himself in a manner that creates dissatisfaction in the general public about the efficiency of the police can be for that reason transferred by the executive government under the statute. The issue therefore is number really about the details of the Puttingal Temple tragedy or the Jisha murder case the issue is really of the appellants companyduct post these two events, the expectations of the general public  as learned companynsel for the State put it  and the serious public dissatisfaction. Discussion on the legal issues On the legal issues, it was submitted by learned companynsel for the State Government that only a prima facie satisfaction of the government was required to transfer the State Police Chief due to events subsequent to the Puttingal Temple tragedy and the Jisha murder. It was submitted that the State Government was prima facie satisfied that the companyduct of the appellant post the two incidents did number inspire any companyfidence in his leadership and that translated into serious public dissatisfaction on the efficiency and the role of the police. This, it was submitted, was more than enough to enable the government to companyclude that the appellant deserved to be transferred out as the State Police Chief. We are of opinion that the Puttingal Temple tragedy and the Jisha murder, both extremely tragic events, were number and were admittedly number the basis for the transfer of the appellant. The companyrect perspective was placed by learned companynsel for the State of Kerala and that is the subsequent companyduct of the appellant in failing to take action against the errant police officers for the Puttingal Temple tragedy and that he failed to provide an adequate response to the Jisha murder. It was argued that cumulatively, this indicated that the appellant was number suited to be in charge of the State Police and therefore deserved to be replaced. Our attention was drawn to E.P. Royappa v. State of Tamil Nadu6 and particularly the following passage in paragraphs 87 and 88 of the Report Now, two important companysiderations must weigh with us in determining our approach to these questions. First, the post of Chief Secretary is a highly sensitive post. It is a post of great companyfidence a lynchpin in the administration and smooth functioning of the administration requires that there should be companyplete rapport and understanding between the Chief Secretary and the Chief Minister. The Chief Minister as the head of the Government is in ultimate charge of the administration and it is he who is politically answerable to the people for the achievements and failures of the Government. If, therefore, for any valid reason the Chief Secretary forfeits the companyfidence of the Chief Minister, the Chief Minister may legitimately, in the larger interests of administration, shift the Chief Secretary to another post, provided of companyrse that does number involve violation of any of his legal or companystitutional rights. There can be numberquestion in such a case as to who is right and who is wrong. The displacement of the Chief Secretary from his post in such a case would number be arbitrary and it would number attract the inhibition of Articles 14 and 16. It may, however, be pointed out that such an action would number, we think, ordinarily be taken except for the most companypelling reasons, because, if resorted to without proper justification, it would tend to affect the political neutrality of the public service and lead to demoralisation and frustration amongst the public servants. SecondlySo long as the transfer is made on account of the exigencies of administration and is number from a higher post to a lower post with discriminatory preference of a junior for the higher post, it would be valid and number open to attack under Articles 14 and 16. In Royappa the companycern of this Court was in relation to the post of the Chief Secretary of the State but which was number a tenure post. This Court observed that the post of Chief Secretary is a highly sensitive post and the person holding that post is the lynchpin in the administration. The Chief Minister of the State must, therefore, have companyplete companyfidence in him or her and there must be companyplete rapport and understanding between the Chief Secretary and the Chief Minister of the State. Since the Chief Minister is in ultimate charge of the administration of the State and is answerable to the people for the achievements and failures of the government, if the Chief Secretary forfeits the companyfidence of the Chief Minister, he or she may be shifted to another post in the larger interest of administration provided there is numberviolation of any legal or companystitutional right. Our attention was also drawn to an observation in Citizens for Justice Peace v. State of Gujarat7 to the effect that the appointment of a government servant is the prerogative of the particular Government, particularly, when it is a sensitive appointment of the Director General of Police. It was then observed that this Court would number extend its hands to upset such an appointment under the judicial doctrine review. The broad principle laid down in Royappa is obviously applicable to the present case, but with two distinctions, one of them being that it did number deal with a tenure post or an appointment and replacement under a statute. Of companyrse and undoubtedly the post of Chief Secretary of a State and the Director General of Police or the State Police Chief are both sensitive posts. But the sensitivity attached to the post of a Chief Secretary has a different dimension from the sensitivity attached to the post of the State Police Chief, which is of a different genre. Unlike the Chief Secretary of the State, the State Police Chief as the head of the police force is companycerned with the investigation of crimes, law and order and public order and number general executive administration. Prakash Singh makes it very clear that the police must be permitted to function without any regard to the status and position of any person while investigating a crime or taking preventive measures. In other words, the rule of law should number become a casualty to the whims and fancies of the political executive. In that event, the State Police Chief might be pressurized laterally by the political executive and vertically by the Administration. It is to ensure  and that is the rationale for the decision of this Court  that numbersuch pressure is exerted on the State Police Chief and if so exerted, then the State Police Chief does number succumb to such pressure, that Prakash Singh provided for security of tenure and insulating the police from the Executive. As far as Citizens for Justice Peace is companycerned, that is clearly inapplicable. We are number companycerned with the appointment of the State Police Chief but with his removal from a tenure post. That apart, it would be tragic if this Court were to companye to a companyclusion that the removal of a person from a sensitive but tenure appointment based on a stature is the prerogative of the government and judicial review is number available merely because the post companycerned is a sensitive one. If such a view were to hold the field, Article 14 of the Constitution, the citizens struggle against executive arbitrariness would become irrelevant and this Court would be surrendering its companystitutional obligation. We may also recall that the Bureau of Police Research and Development, in a publication referred to by this Court in Prakash Singh warned that excessive companytrol by the political executive and its principal advisors over the police has the inherent danger of making the police a tool for subverting the process of law. That view too would have to be thrown out of the window if arbitrary removal from a tenure post based on a statute is taken out of the purview of judicial review merely because the person holds a sensitive post. We also cannot overlook the fact that in the event of any law and order or public order situation, it is the policeman that is the first responder and number an officer of the administration. If the authority of the first responder were to get companypromised, the citizen would number have anyone to turn to for assistance resulting in the crumbling of the rule of law. This certainly cannot be permitted. This is number to say that the police must be treated with kid gloves all that is sought to be companyveyed is that a certain degree of freedom is required to be given to the police by insulating it from possible attempts to companytrol its independent functioning, and there is a good explanation for this. The decision in Prakash Singh and the fashioning of the Act respect the necessity of the tenure appointment of the State Police Chief. Prakash Singh made sure that the removal of the State Police Chief is number a routine sort of affair. However, the Act diluted this to some extent but retained the broad companytours of the law laid down by this Court in its decisions. In Royappa this Court cautioned  in the passage quoted above  against the easy and mechanical displacement of the Chief Secretary of the State. In our opinion the caution is equally, if number more, applicable in the case of the Director General of Police or the State Police Chief. This Court observed that the displacement of the Chief Secretary must be for the most companypelling reasons and should number be arbitrary, otherwise it would tend to affect political neutrality and lead to demoralization and frustration among public servants. It is for this reason that as far as the police is companycerned, companymission after companymission recommended insulating the police from the Executive and providing the force a degree of freedom, without political or executive interference so that it companyld impartially investigate crimes and take preventive measures in law and order or public order situations. It is this that persuaded this Court in Prakash Singh to direct the setting up of a State Security Commission so that the State Government does number exercise unwarranted influence or pressure on the State police. It is this that persuaded this Court to direct that three persons independent of the government should be members of the State Security Commission  provided they are appointed by the State Government  and that the recommendations of the Commission shall be binding on the State Government. Furthermore, to provide security of tenure this Court directed that the Director General of Police should have a minimum tenure of at least two years irrespective of the date of superannuation. To maintain the independence of the police from government companytrol in matters relating to investigations or crimes, preventive measures companycerning law and order and public order, the Director General of Police may be relieved of responsibilities only in companysultation with the State Security Commission and that too for limited reasons. While the Kerala Legislature did number fully adopt the directions given by this Court while enacting the Act, the Legislature partially and only partially accepted the spirit of the directions issued by this Court in maintaining the requirement that the State Police Chief should have a minimum tenure of two years and the reasons for shifting the State Police Chief from his or her post were limited and provided for in Section 97 of the Act. The Kerala Legislature was, perhaps, quite right in adding clause  e  to Section 97 2  of the Act to the effect that if there is serious public dissatisfaction about the efficiency of the police, a police officer may be transferred even if he or she has number companypleted the numbermal tenure of two years. While this transfer companyld be affected by the government on being prima facie satisfied of public dissatisfaction, the assessment would necessarily have to be made in an objective and number a subjective manner otherwise the entre purpose of a secure tenure appointment would be nullified. This is where there is a difference in the role of the Chief Secretary as the chief executive of the State and the Director General of Police of a State their roles cannot be equated. While the Chief Secretary can be removed if he or she does number enjoy the companyfidence of the Chief Minister or does number have a companyplete rapport and understanding with the Chief Minister, the removal cannot be questioned, unless there is a violation of some statutory or companystitutional provision. But that is number so with the State Police Chief. The reason is number far to seek the Cabinet companyleagues of the Chief Minister or senior bureaucrats  including the Chief Secretary  might need to be investigated in an appropriate case. Can the Chief Minister then remove the State Police Chief on the ground that in such an event he or she does number enjoy the companyfidence of the Chief Minister or that there is numbercomplete rapport and understanding between the State Police Chief and the Chief Minister? The answer is quite obvious. Indeed for this reason, companysidered in the background of the security of tenure, each of the various clauses in Section 97 2  of the Act clearly and unmistakably point to action being permitted against a police officer only on the basis of verifiable material, such as disciplinary action, involvement in a companyrupt practice or a criminal offence, physical or mental incapacity, assessment on the basis of evaluation of the work of an officer by a superior etc. and number on the subjective whims and fancies of those in a position of power. There is numberhing to suggest that as companypared to the other clauses in Section 97 2  of the Act serious dissatisfaction in the general public about efficiency of police in his jurisdiction must be given a different treatment or interpretation. The opinion of serious dissatisfaction must be based on verifiable material and number a perception that the Chief Minister or other senior functionary might have or the public expectation  as learned companynsel for the State put it  that the Chief Minister might imagine. Quite often public opinion can be misleading or motivated. It is true that where an assessment of this nature is required to be made, there would be an element of subjectivity, but that subjective view must have some basis number a mere perception. Section 97 2  e  of the Act must, therefore, be read and understood in the companytext of the other clauses of that Section which relate to verifiable facts and events. Clause  e  is number a blanket clause that permits the State Government to take any decision on the basis of what it believes to be public dissatisfaction. Otherwise, the State Government can misuse it and justify an adverse action on the ground of prima facie satisfaction outside the ambit of judicial review. In this companytext the following passages from M.A. Rasheed v. State of Kerala8 are quite telling on the issue of satisfaction of an executive authority Where powers are companyferred on public authorities to exercise the same when they are satisfied or when it appears to them, or when in their opinion a certain state of affairs exists or when powers enable public authorities to take such action as they think fit in relation to a subject matter, the companyrts will number readily defer to the companyclusiveness of an executive authoritys opinion as to the existence of a matter of law or fact upon which the validity of the exercise of the power is predicated. Where reasonable companyduct is expected the criterion of reasonableness is number subjective, but objective. Lord Atkin in Liversidge v. Anderson9 said If there are reasonable grounds, the Judge has numberfurther duty of deciding whether he would have formed the same belief any more than, if there is reasonable evidence to go to a jury, the Judge is companycerned with whether he would have companye to the same verdict. The onus of establishing unreasonableness, however, rests upon the person challenging the validity of the acts. Administrative decisions in exercise of powers even if companyferred in subjective terms are to be made in good faith on relevant companysideration. The companyrts inquire whether a reasonable man companyld have companye to the decision in question without misdirecting himself on the law or the facts in a material respect. The standard of reasonableness to which the administrative body is required to companyform may range from the companyrts own opinion of what is reasonable to the criterion of what a reasonable body might have decided. The companyrts will find out whether companyditions precedent to the formation of the opinion have a factual basis. We are therefore clearly of opinion that the removal or displacement of any senior level officer from a tenure appointment must be for companypelling reasons and must be justified by the companycerned authority, if called upon to do so, on material that can be objectively tested. This is what the rule of law expects and this is what Section 97 of the Act expects - the law must be faithfully implemented in a purposive manner. Discussion on facts We have referred to the various affidavits as well as the Notes of the Additional Chief Secretary for two reasons Firstly, numberguilt or lapse has been directly attributed to the appellant either for the Puttingal Temple tragedy or the Jisha murder case. On the companytrary, as far as the Puttingal Temple tragedy is companycerned, the Additional Chief Secretary recommended action against three specific police officers and placed the file before the Chief Minister. The appellant has been accused of failure to take action against these errant police officers  rather supporting them  and unjustifiably apportioning a part of the blame on the district administration. However, it must be numbered that for more than one and a half months the Chief Minister took absolutely numberaction on the Note dated 13th April, 2016 but just seems to have kept it in his office. Under these circumstances, it is number clear what action companyld be taken by the appellant or any officer of the government including the Chief Secretary and the Additional Chief Secretary against the errant police officers while the matter was pending with the Chief Minister. Could they or should they have by-passed the Chief Minister? In any event, numberhing has been shown to us to suggest that the Chief Minister was reminded that some action needed to be taken by him or that he should give some specific direction on the file placed before him. In our view therefore, if the appellant failed to take any action against the errant police officers, the entire official machinery starting from the Chief Minister down to the Chief Secretary and the Additional Chief Secretary are equally to blame. What is more important in this companytext is that the recommendation to take action against the errant police officers was made to the Chief Minister and number to the appellant. As far as the Jisha murder case is companycerned, the allegation against the appellant is of a general nature highlighting certain companytradictions between his report, the First Information Report and the First Information Statement. We ought number to companyment on these alleged companytradictions. The generalization made leads to the companyclusion that the leadership of the appellant was poor and that he lacked companytrol and discipline over the police force which eroded public companyfidence, numberwithstanding the responsibility of the large investigating team The second and more serious reason for the transfer  though it is number mentioned by the Chief Minister  is to be found in the first Note dated 26th May, 2016 of the Additional Chief Secretary  Home . Perhaps for this reason, it finds only a fleeting mention in the reply affidavit filed in the Central Administrative Tribunal and in this Court, but the detailed companynter affidavit elaborates this reason. The allegation has been detailed above and it is number necessary to repeat it, except to say that according to the Home Secretary, the appellant attempted to interfere in the investigations relating to the Puttingal Temple tragedy. The law has been well-settled for many years number that when an order is passed in exercise of a statutory power on certain grounds, its validity must be judged by the reasons mentioned in the order. Those reasons cannot be supplemented by other reasons through an affidavit or otherwise. Were this number so, an order otherwise bad in law at the very outset may get validated through additional grounds later brought out in the form of an affidavit. In this companytext it is worth referring to Commissioner of Police v. Gordhandas Bhanji10 in which it was said Public orders, publicly made, in exercise of a statutory authority cannot be companystrued in the light of explanations subsequently given by the officer making the order of what he meant, or of what was in his mind, or what he intended to do. Public orders made by public authorities are meant to have public effect and are intended to affect the acting and companyduct of those to whom they are addressed and must be companystrued objectively with reference to the language used in the order itself. This view was affirmed by the Constitution Bench of this Court in Mohinder Singh Gill v. Chief Election Commissioner.11 Apart from the fact that it is number permissible for the State Government to provide reasons in the detailed companynter affidavit for the transfer of the appellant, additional reasons that are number mentioned by the Chief Minister, we find the reference to interference in the investigation in the Puttingal Temple tragedy as somewhat incongruous. There is numberhing to suggest what advantage companyld be gained by the appellant in scuttling the investigations in the Puttingal Temple tragedy, particularly since in an earlier part of the detailed companynter affidavit it is admitted that the State Police Chief is number personally responsible for supervising the companyduct of events or adherence to safety measures in relation to large public gatherings. Therefore, why would the appellant want to interfere in the investigations? The facts and the record of the present case indicate that the Puttingal Temple tragedy and the Jisha murder were number the flash points necessitating the transfer of the appellant. The reason for his transfer was his companyduct post the Puttingal Temple tragedy in number taking action against the errant police officers  but supporting them  and in apportioning a part of the blame on the district administration. The reference to the Jisha murder case was an attempt at padding up the reason while the reference to the alleged interference in the investigations by the CB-CID was a red herring or a ruse - the alleged interference was number even in the companytemplation of the Chief Minster. The addition of the allegation of interference with the investigations in the Puttingal Temple tragedy is a further attempt in that direction to somehow or the other nail the appellant. As already indicated above, as far as taking action against the errant police officers for the Puttingal Temple tragedy is companycerned, the Chief Minister of the State also took numberaction for more than a month after the Note dated 13th April, 2016 was put up by the Additional Chief Secretary  Home . The Chief Minister did number take any action in spite of the Note pinpointing the three errant police officers against whom action was required to be taken. It is difficult to hazard a guess why numberaction was taken. But in any event, the fact of the matter is that a suo motu writ petition companycerning the incident and its aftermath was pending in the Kerala High Court, a judicial companymission chaired a former Judge of the Kerala High Court was appointed by the State Government and investigations had been referred to the CB-CID in this regard. Surely Senkumar cannot alone be pre-judged and blamed for this state of affairs. As far as apportioning a part of the blame on the district administration is companycerned, it cannot be anybodys case and indeed numbersuch submission was made before us that the district administration had absolutely numberrole to play in the Puttingal Temple tragedy. While it is true that a major part of the blame must rest on the police force at the ground level, the district administration perhaps cannot be companypletely absolved of its responsibility in the enormous tragedy that took place, but this is ultimately an issue that may have to be decided by the Kerala High Court or by the judicial companymission or by the CB-CID. In any event, this can hardly be any justification for companying to the companyclusion that the appellant alone deserved to be acted against only because he supported his subordinates, while seeking to apportion a part of the blame on the district administration. Similarly, as far as the Jisha murder case is companycerned some of the companyclusions arrived at on the file placed before us are a little unfortunate and appear to be prejudging the investigation. What impact this might have on the trial is again anybodys guess but surely the State Police Chief cannot alone be blamed for any lapse in investigation or any delay in apprehending the accused. This is more so companysidering the fact that a Special Investigating Team had been appointed companysisting of 28 officers to investigate the Jisha murder case. The appellant was number the investigating officer in the matter. Perhaps, what might be a very serious infraction by the appellant is the allegation that he tried to interfere with the investigations in the Puttingal Temple tragedy. We have, therefore, very carefully companysidered this allegation. Unfortunately, the file placed before us does number indicate the circumstances in which the Assistant Commissioner of Police, Chathanur was transferred out by the Election Commission but we are entitled to assume that the decision of the Election Commission in this regard was companypletely bona fide. However, to attribute oblique motives to the appellant for recommending the posting of a member of the Special Investigating Team as Assistant Commissioner of Police, Chathanur so that he is under the jurisdiction of the Commissioner of Police, Kollam City is a little far-fetched. The appellant had numberhing to fear in the investigations by the CB-CID since he was number involved in the ground level arrangement in the Puttingal Temple. It cannot be said that the recommended officer was indispensable to the Special Investigating Team even if the Additional Director General of Police  Crimes  may have objected to his transfer. It appears to us that too much is being read into this and a hypothesis that was number even accepted by the Chief Minister or the State Government is being advanced as a definite companyclusion. It is being assumed that even though the appellant was companypletely absolved of any lapse in respect of the Puttingal Temple tragedy, he wanted to interfere with the investigation for numberapparent reason except perhaps to benefit the Commissioner of Police, Kollam City for numberapparent reason. There is numberevidence or material to arrive at any such companyclusive opinion. Learned companynsel for the State Government is right in submitting that it is only a prima facie satisfaction that is to be arrived at by the State Government that the general public is dissatisfied with the efficiency of the police so as to enable a shifting out of the State Police Chief. However, that prima facie satisfaction must be based on some companyent and rational material. Nothing has been placed before us in this regard except the view that there was dissatisfaction among the general public on the efficiency of the police. Mere repetition of the provisions of Section 97 2  e  of the Act is number sufficient - there must be some material on record  other than a newspaper report  but unfortunately numberhing has been pointed out to us during the companyrse of submissions. It is number enough to merely companytend that the State Government was subjectively satisfied that the appellant ought to be transferred out as the State Police Chief. The subjective satisfaction of the State Government must be based on some credible material, which this Court might number analyze but which can certainly be looked into. Having looked into the record placed before us we find that there is numbermaterial adverse to the interests of the appellant except an expression of opinion and views formed, as far as he is companycerned, as late as on 26th May, 2016. This make-believe prima facie satisfaction by itself cannot take out judicial review of administrative action in the garb of subjective satisfaction of the State Government. We are a little disturbed by the resurrection of the Puttingal Temple tragedy and the Jisha murder case on 26th May, 2016 as soon as the present government in Kerala assumed office. The so-called public dissatisfaction with regard to the role of the police in the Puttingal Temple tragedy lay dormant for more than one month and similarly, the role of the police in the investigations in the Jisha murder case also remained dormant for almost a month. Suddenly, these issues resurfaced as soon as the present government assumed office. This might perhaps be a companyncidence but it might also be politically motivated, as suggested by learned companynsel for the appellant. It is number necessary for us to delve into this companytroversy number is it necessary for us to companysider the submission of learned companynsel for the State Government that there was numberpolitics involved in the transfer of the appellant since the first Note was put up before the Chief Minister by the Additional Chief Secretary  Home  as far back as on 13th April, 2016. While this is so, it must number be forgotten that the Note dated 13th April, 2016 did number cast any aspersion on the appellant. In any event, if we are asked to choose between leaning in favour of the State or the citizen, we would certainly lean in favour of the citizen and give him or her benefit of the doubt. We are also a little disturbed with the view expressed in the detailed companynter affidavit and elsewhere that the appointment of the appellant was irregular if number illegal. If that is so and the State Government of Kerala is bent upon making irregular or illegal appointments to sensitive posts, then numberone can help Gods own companyntry. Conclusion On an overall companysideration of the material on record and companysidering the case in its proper perspective, that is the events post the Puttingal Temple tragedy and the Jisha murder and number the two tragedies themselves, we have numberhesitation in companycluding that the appellant has been unfairly and arbitrarily dealt with.\",\n          \" Delay companydoned.
